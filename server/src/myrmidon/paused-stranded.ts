 * Operator-paused agents' issues are not stranded (L3b).

 * With L3 (`pause-drain.ts`) an operator pause means "give no new work, let
 * the current one finish", and resuming the agent wakes its `todo` /
 * `in_progress` issues (`resumeAgentAfterPause`). The vendor's periodic
 * stranded-assigned-issue sweep (`reconcileStrandedAssignedIssues`) does not
 * know that: it checks "the agent is not invokable" before it looks for a
 * live execution path, so it blocks every issue of a paused agent and files a
 * board recovery card for it, including an issue whose run is still draining.
 * Once blocked, an issue is no longer `todo`/`in_progress`, so resume would
 * not wake it either.
 *
 * Same setting as L3: `MYRMIDON_PAUSE_DRAINS` off gives the vendor behavior.

/**
 * Whether the stranded-assigned-issue sweep must leave an issue alone because
 * its agent is paused by the operator. For such an agent a `todo`/
 * `in_progress` issue is either being worked on (a live, draining run) or
 * waits for the operator's resume. Both outcomes are "skip", so the decision
 * needs no run lookup: only the agent's state and the setting.
 *
 * Not exempt, so the vendor behavior stays:
 * - `MYRMIDON_PAUSE_DRAINS` off;
 * - any system pause reason (budget, archive, import, plugin note, unknown)
 *   and any other non-invokable state (terminated, pending approval, a broken
 *   reporting chain);
 * - an agent of another company or a missing agent.
 *
 * An `in_review` issue is exempt too. Its reviewer is re-queued by the sweep
 * itself once the agent is invokable again (`enqueueStrandedIssueRecovery` on
 * the review-participant path), so leaving it alone while the pause holds is
 * "wait for the resume" there as well. The vendor block for it exists because
 * the sweep assumes a non-invokable participant means an abandoned review;
 * with an operator pause that assumption is false, and blocking the issue
 * would make resume unable to wake it (a blocked issue is no longer the
 * sweep's candidate).
 *
 * `drainsEnabled` defaults to the live setting; tests pass it explicitly.
