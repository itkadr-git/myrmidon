// myrmidon(1.6-CTO-CHAT-B): the HTTP entry of the planner.
//
// POST /api/myrmidon/cto-chat/plan — the owner's free text in, a proposed epic
// with child tasks out. The chat screen (the portal half of this feature) calls
// it over HTTP rather than through the chat socket: the socket carries the
// conversation, this call is one deliberate "build me an epic" action, and a
// proposal is a request/response thing, not a stream.
//
// The route CREATES NOTHING. It answers with a proposal; the caller decides
// whether to show it and, if it wants an approval card, which task to put it on.
// That keeps the planner safe to call from a chat composer while the owner is
// still typing, and it keeps task creation on the card's own acceptance path.
//
// Shapes:
//   200 { proposal: { planId, epic, epicClientKey, tasks[] }, payload: the
//        ready suggest_tasks payload for the approval card }
//   400 body fails ctoChatPlanRequestSchema (repo convention); planner errors
//        other than "not configured" (empty/too long message, backend
//        failed/unreachable, invalid model output) also surface as 400
//   503 the planner is not configured, or its model key is not available
//
// `hostIssueId` is optional and only selects the task the caller wants the
// proposal to be discussed on; when it is absent the proposal is not attached
// anywhere and nothing about it is stored.
