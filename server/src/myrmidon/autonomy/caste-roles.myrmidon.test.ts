//
// myrmidon(1.6.1 CUSTOM-CASTES B): the autonomy matrix regression tests for
// caste (non-standard) roles.
//
// The ticket's criterion: "moving an agent to a caste must not change any
// verdict" — the schema does not change, the caste key is the role string,
// and the matrix keeps resolving exactly as before. Pinned here:
//
//   1. rows keyed by caste keys resolve by the same specificity order
//      (agent > role > default) as the built-in roles;
//   2. translating an agent from a built-in role to a caste role leaves the
//      verdicts identical (the "rights did not shrink" acceptance);
//   3. a caste key unknown to the matrix falls to the default, never to an
//      accident.
//
// Neutral data only: agent-a, company-a.
