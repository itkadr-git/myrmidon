/**
 * L5: the issue write lock (`issue_write_assignee_run_lock`, HTTP 409) used to
 * fire off the issue's own `status` field alone — any issue sitting at
 * `in_progress` blocked every other agent's write, even when the assignee had
 * no run actually going. A manager could not write to a subordinate's parent
 * task the moment its subtree touched `in_progress`, with nothing live behind
 * it, and the 409's "a run is live" copy was not true in that case.
 *
 * This only reports the lock as live when the assignee's checkout or
 * execution run is itself still non-terminal: `running`, `queued`, or
 * `scheduled_retry`. `queued` counts: a run waiting for an admission slot
 * (see run-admission.ts) still owns the issue, it just has not started yet.
 * `scheduled_retry` counts too: on a transient failure the vendor reuses the
 * *same* issue lock for the retry — it re-points `issues.executionRunId` at
 * the newly inserted `scheduled_retry` run while requiring the issue to stay
 * `in_progress` (server/src/services/heartbeat.ts, the retry-scheduling path
 * around the `AI_CONNECTION_BUSY_RETRY_REASON`/max-turn-continuation checks),
 * so the assignee's run is about to resume on this exact issue. This matches
 * the vendor's own non-terminal/active-run definition, used consistently
 * elsewhere in heartbeat.ts: `EXECUTION_PATH_HEARTBEAT_RUN_STATUSES` and
 * `CANCELLABLE_HEARTBEAT_RUN_STATUSES` are both
 * `["queued", "running", "scheduled_retry"]`, and the two queries that decide
 * whether an issue already has an active run use that same triple. A run in
 * a genuinely terminal state, or no run at all, no longer justifies the
 * lock.
 *
 * `tasks:manage_active_checkouts` (server/src/services/authorization.ts)
 * keeps overriding the lock entirely and is evaluated before this module is
 * ever reached — see docs/myrmidon/design/issue-write-lock.md for how to grant
 * it, and how this fits the rest of the write-lock decision.
