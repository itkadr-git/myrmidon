// myrmidon(L2, round 1 fix): supersedes a settled "do not replay" hold that
// an explicitly authorized wake carrying no message of its own (assignment,
// manual wakeup, approval decision, subtree resume) bypassed, atomically
// with the successor run the caller is about to create under
// `successorRunId`. Mirrors the vendor's own resolution shape for a
// verified successor (explicit-native-continuation.ts's
// `explicit_user_continuation`, native-safe-replacement.ts's
// `verified_safe_replacement`): without this, the hold never records its
// own end, and it keeps blocking every later *automatic* continuation of
// that successor as if it were still open — a scheduled retry
// (scheduleBoundedRetryForRun), a resource-wait continuation
// (recovery/service.ts's `issue_continuation_needed`), release-time wake
// promotion (wake-queue's postgres adapter), a pause-resume wake
// (pause-drain.ts) — none of which re-derive "explicit" the way the
// original bypassed wake did. See wake-classification.ts,
// explicit-wake-bypass.ts and docs/myrmidon/DIVERGENCE.md "L2".
