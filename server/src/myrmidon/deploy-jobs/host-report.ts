// Board self-deploy (myrmidon R5-A): the host-report channel.
//
// deploy.sh --from-job (the new mode of scripts/myrmidon/deploy) writes a
// small JSON report next to its state directory: $STATE_DIR/job-<id>.json.
// The board container cannot read the host filesystem — the deployment mounts
// the reports directory read-only at MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_REPORTS_DIR (the same
// directory the scripts write to), and this module reads the file from there.
// No exec, no docker socket: the channel is one JSON file per job, host →
// board only. The board never writes into it.
//
// R5-C adds the rollback phases: after a failed health check the executor
// (with the automatic rollback on) reports `rolling-back` while it switches
// the image back to the locally remembered previous one, then `rolled-back`
// (the previous image is healthy again) or `rollback-failed` (the rollback
// itself failed — the window stays on for the operator).
