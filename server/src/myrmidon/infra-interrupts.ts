/**
 * Infrastructure interruptions do not create an operator recovery hold (L1).
 *
 * A run that ends because of infrastructure (an agent pause, a lost process, a
 * server shutdown, or the issue being reassigned mid-run) is not evidence
 * against the agent or the provider: nothing about the work it did is in
 * question. The vendor's reconciliation gate (legacy-execution-recovery.ts)
 * and the stranded-assigned-issue sweep (services/recovery/service.ts) both
 * treat every terminal run the same way and ask a human to reconcile it. For
 * the error codes named here, that hold is skipped instead, mirroring the
 * existing maintenance-interrupt exception (myrmidon/maintenance/domain.ts,
 * MAINTENANCE_INTERRUPT_ERROR_CODE): the original executor gets a bounded
 * retry, and a reassigned issue is simply released for its new assignee to
 * pick up on its own.
 *
 * This relies on the retry (or the immediate continuation) being safe to
 * issue blindly, without knowing what the interrupted attempt already did.
 * That is only true for the run's own adapter, so every entry point here is
 * gated by adapterQualifiesForInfraInterruptRelief: a conversation adapter
 * (services/conversation-continuation.ts's CONVERSATION_ADAPTER_TYPES) hands
 * a fresh turn to the provider and lets it decide what remains, so a repeat
 * invocation is not a replay of the original action. A process/webhook-style
 * adapter (process, http, openclaw_gateway, …) has no such contract -- the
 * vendor's own CONVERSATION_ADAPTER_TYPES comment is explicit that retrying
 * one of those "can replay the action itself" -- so this exception leaves the
 * vendor's hold in place for them until they carry an idempotency key of
 * their own (see IDEMPOTENT_INFRA_INTERRUPT_ADAPTER_TYPES). An unclaimed or
 * unknown adapter type is treated the same as a non-qualifying one: this
 * exception never assumes a safety it cannot see.
 *
 * The exception also stays out of the way while the provider stop is only
 * requested, not confirmed (infraInterruptStopUnconfirmed): the next turn --
 * a resume, or a new assignee after a reassignment -- could otherwise
 * overlap the old turn that has not actually stopped.
 *
 * Setting: MYRMIDON_INFRA_INTERRUPT_CODES, docs/myrmidon/SETTINGS.md.
