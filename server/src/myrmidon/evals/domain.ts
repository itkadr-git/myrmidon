// myrmidon(1.6-EVALS): the pure part of the reference-task evaluation path.
//
// A company keeps a set of reference tasks for one role. A run sends each
// task's prompt to a subject, the judge (an LLM behind the company's gateway)
// scores the answer against the task rubric, and the aggregate decides
// whether the subject is promoted, needs a confirmation run, or regressed.
// This file has no database and no Express: it holds the types, the score
// threshold logic, and the SKILL-LIFECYCLE seam. The store-bound
// service and the routes sit on top.
