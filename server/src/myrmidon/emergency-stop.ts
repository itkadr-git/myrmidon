// Emergency stop (myrmidon(EMERGENCY-STOP), plan 1.1.2 item 17): immediately
// cancel the runs a draining operator pause left running.
//
// Since L3 the operator pause (`POST /agents/:id/pause`) drains by default:
// active runs keep running to completion so a pause does not manufacture a
// wall of reconciliation holds. That is the right default for deploys and
// nights, but the owner sometimes needs the runs to stop *now* — a runaway
// spend, an agent doing something wrong — and the only immediate lever was
// `POST /agents/:id/pause` with `{cancelActive: true}`, which also flips the
// agent status and is not discoverable from the board UI.
//
// This module is that lever, separate from pausing:
//
// - it only cancels what the pause deliberately left running. It targets the
//   same run statuses the pause-cancel path targets (`queued`, `running`,
//   `scheduled_retry` — CANCELLABLE_HEARTBEAT_RUN_STATUSES) through the same
//   `heartbeat.cancelActiveForAgent` call the explicit `cancelActive: true`
//   pause request uses, so the errorCode is `agent_paused`: an infrastructure
//   interruption in MYRMIDON_INFRA_INTERRUPT_CODES, which L1 already keeps
//   from creating a `legacy_execution_requires_reconciliation` hold (for a
//   conversation adapter, within the shared retry budget) and from an
//   immediate `stranded_assigned_issue` escalation. Unpausing then resumes
//   the affected work through the normal L3 `resumeAgentAfterPause` path.
// - it does not change the agent's own status: a paused agent stays paused,
//   an active agent stays active. Emergency stop is "stop the runs", not
//   "pause the agent"; combining the two is what the pause route is for.
//
// Accepted race: the route does not touch agent status, so it can interleave
// with an unpause or a fresh wakeup that lands at the same moment. Runs that
// start after the cancel snapshot are simply not cancelled (the operator can
// press the button again), and runs cancelled just before an unpause are
// resumed by the normal L3 path. Neither outcome loses work or corrupts state.
//
// The route lives under /api/myrmidon (CONVENTIONS.md #8) and applies the
// same permission path as the vendor's pause route (getAccessibleAgent →
// assertBoardCanManageAgentsForCompany): board actor, company access and the
// `agents:create` grant, so a board member with only read access cannot stop
// an agent's runs.
