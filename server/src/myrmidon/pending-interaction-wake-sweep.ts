/**
 * Pending interaction addressee wake sweep (P12).
 *
 * Creating an issue-thread interaction addressed to an agent wakes that agent
 * with `wakeReason: interaction_pending`. When the task already has an active
 * run, the wake is parked in `deferred_issue_execution` instead of queued, and
 * only the release paths of *that task's own runs* promote it again
 * (`releaseIssueExecutionAndPromote` → `runReleaseDrain` → `promoteDeferredWake`).
 * A task with no runs at all therefore never promotes the parked wake: the
 * interaction stays unnoticed for days, expires by its own deadline (or is
 * superseded by a comment), and the receipt keeps starving in the queue.
 *
 * The sweep closes both halves of that gap on the scheduler tick:
 *
 * - The interaction a wake announced is no longer waiting (answered, expired,
 *   superseded, withdrawn) or its task is closed → the receipt is finalized as
 *   `cancelled` with the reason, so the wake's lifecycle follows the
 *   interaction's lifecycle instead of outliving it.
 * - The interaction is still waiting for that agent and no run holds the task →
 *   the receipt is re-admitted through the ordinary wake admission, which
 *   creates the queued run the parked wake never got. Bounded by
 *   `MYRMIDON_PENDING_INTERACTION_WAKE_RE_ADMISSIONS` per receipt, so a wake
 *   cannot storm a task every tick when the addressee never answers.
 *
 * A receipt whose own run is still going, or whose task is held by another live
 * run, is left alone: those paths own the delivery.
