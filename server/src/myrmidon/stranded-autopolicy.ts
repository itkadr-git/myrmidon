// myrmidon(L4): a successful run that leaves an issue without an explicit
// disposition (`stranded_assigned_issue` / `successful_run_missing_state`,
// both only when the *last* run status is "succeeded" — a failed run is L1's
// concern) resolves by policy instead of escalating straight to an owner
// card ("Myrmidon needs a disposition…" / "board decision is required").
//
// Policy, applied from the single choke point every such escalation already
// passes through (`escalateStrandedAssignedIssue` in
// `server/src/services/recovery/service.ts`):
//
//  1. Up to `MYRMIDON_STRANDED_AUTO_RETRIES_PER_DAY` (default 2) times within
//     a rolling 24h window, send the assignee a normal continuation wake that
//     explicitly asks it to record a final disposition (done / in_review /
//     blocked with a reason / todo with a reason).
//  2. Once that window's retries are used up, hand the issue to the
//     assignee's direct manager (`agents.reportsTo`) as the `in_review`
//     reviewer, if that manager exists, belongs to the same company and is
//     invokable, *and* the issue carries no execution policy of any kind, no
//     monitor state and no execution state in flight (see
//     `issueHasExistingExecutionWorkflow` below — a policy with no stages
//     still holds the trust boundary, the review preset or a monitor, a
//     monitor state keeps its own history, and a non-idle state covers a
//     repeat handoff attempt on an issue this policy already handed off
//     once). A system comment explains why. Approving the review closes the
//     issue as done; requesting changes sends it back to the original
//     assignee.
//  3. No eligible manager, or an execution workflow is already in effect —
//     fall back to the vendor's own board escalation unchanged
//     (`vendor_default`).
//
// A `paused` assignee is exempt from all of the above: pausing is not
// stranding. An auto-retry wake to a paused agent can only throw (paused is
// not invokable), and a manager handoff would take the paused agent's work
// under review over something that is not stuck. So this policy adds nothing
// of its own while the assignee is paused — no retry wake, no manager
// handoff — and the vendor's own handling of a non-invokable assignee
// applies unchanged, as it did before this policy existed
// (`vendor_default`). That handling still includes the vendor's board card
// and the `blocked` status: L4 neither suppresses them nor promises that
// anything wakes the issue after a resume. Which paths keep the vendor
// behavior for a paused assignee is recorded in `DIVERGENCE.md` (rows L3b
// and L4).
//
// The attempt count is derived from persisted heartbeat runs tagged with
// `STRANDED_AUTO_POLICY_RETRY_SOURCE`, not a separate mutable counter, so
// reprocessing the same issue on a later sweep tick naturally sees the
// updated count instead of double-counting or double-waking: see
// `countStrandedAutoPolicyAttemptsInWindow` below and its `*.myrmidon.test.ts`.
//
// `MYRMIDON_STRANDED_AUTOPOLICY_ENABLED=false` is a full kill switch back to
// the vendor's own board escalation, for incident rollback without a code
// revert (`MYRMIDON_STRANDED_AUTO_RETRIES_PER_DAY=0` alone still hands the
// issue straight to a manager when one is configured — see
// `readStrandedAutoPolicyEnabled` below).
