/**
 * Non-throwing access check for routes that look up a resource by id
 * before responding. Prefer this over `assertCompanyAccess` whenever the
 * route can reach the access check only after a successful `getById`
 * (i.e. after confirming the resource exists).
 *
 * Using `assertCompanyAccess` in that position leaks resource existence
 * across tenants: a 404 means "no such resource" while a 403 means "exists
 * in another tenant". Any authenticated user can enumerate IDs and
 * distinguish the two responses.
 *
 * Most routes should use `getAccessibleResource` below, which wraps the
 * whole pattern. When composing manually (bespoke not-found responses),
 * the shape is:
 *
 *     const issue = await svc.getById(id);
 *     if (!issue || !hasCompanyAccess(req, issue.companyId)) {
 *       res.status(404).json({ error: "Issue not found" });
 *       return;
 *     }
 *
 * so both "does not exist" and "exists but cross-tenant" return the same
 * 404, removing the oracle.
 *
 * Note: this intentionally does not replicate the write-path membership
 * checks in `assertCompanyAccess` (active membership, viewer read-only).
 * Routes that need those checks for authorized tenants should still call
 * `assertCompanyAccess` after the 404 gate — the oracle concern is only
 * about the existence check.
 *
 * The company-scope semantics must stay in lockstep with
 * `assertCompanyAccess`: in particular, signed-in instance admins do NOT
 * get blanket access to companies they are not a member of.
