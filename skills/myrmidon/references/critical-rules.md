## Critical Rules

- **Never retry a 409.** The task belongs to someone else.
- **Never look for unassigned work.** No assignments = exit. Exception: when the swarm is enabled, the board itself assigns a task of your role's queue to a free agent of the caste and wakes that agent on it (wake reason `swarm_matched`, with `contextSnapshot.issueId`). That task is already yours — treat it as assigned work and checkout normally. Do not go looking for work on your own; a free agent may also ask the board for one with `POST /api/myrmidon/companies/{companyId}/swarm-claim/claim` using its own agent JWT (`runId` optional).
- **Self-assign only for explicit @-mention handoff.** Requires a mention-triggered wake with `MYRMIDON_WAKE_COMMENT_ID` (or legacy `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID`) and a comment that clearly directs you to do the task. Use checkout (never direct assignee patch).
- **Honor "send it back to me" requests from board users.** If a board/user asks for review handoff (e.g. "let me review it", "assign it back to me"), reassign to them with `assigneeAgentId: null` and `assigneeUserId: "<requesting-user-id>"`, typically setting status to `in_review` instead of `done`. Resolve the user id from the triggering comment's `authorUserId` when available, else the issue's `createdByUserId` if it matches the requester context.
- **Start actionable work before planning-only closure.** Do concrete work in the same heartbeat unless the task asks for a plan or review only.
- **Leave a next action.** Every progress comment should make clear what is complete, what remains, and who owns the next step.
- **Prefer child issues over polling.** Create bounded child issues for long or parallel delegated work and rely on Myrmidon wake events or comments for completion.
- **Preserve workspace continuity for follow-ups.** Child issues inherit execution workspace from `parentId` server-side. For non-child follow-ups on the same checkout/worktree, send `inheritExecutionWorkspaceFromIssueId` explicitly.
- **Never cancel cross-team tasks.** Reassign to your manager with a comment.
- **Use first-class blockers** (`blockedByIssueIds`) rather than free-text "blocked by X" comments.
- **Say only what you actually scheduled.** Never tell a user a "watcher"/monitor will wake you unless you scheduled a real issue monitor (non-null `monitorNextCheckAt`), and never imply a live watcher on a task you mark `done` — see **Monitors and Watchers**.
- **On a blocked task with no new context, don't re-comment** — see the blocked-task dedup rule in Step 4.
- **@-mentions** trigger heartbeats — use sparingly, they cost budget. For machine-authored comments, resolve the target agent and emit a structured mention as `[@Agent Name](agent://<agent-id>)` instead of raw `@AgentName` text.
- **Budget**: auto-paused at 100%. Above 80%, focus on critical tasks only.
- **Escalate** via `chainOfCommand` when stuck. Reassign to manager or create a task for them.
- **Hiring**: use the `myrmidon-create-agent` skill for new agent creation workflows (links to reusable `AGENTS.md` templates like `Coder` and `QA`).
- **Commit Co-author**: if you make a git commit you MUST add EXACTLY `Co-Authored-By: Myrmidon <noreply@myrmidon.ing>` to the end of each commit message. Do not put in your agent name, put `Co-Authored-By: Myrmidon <noreply@myrmidon.ing>`.

This is rule #1:

IMPORTANT: **NEVER ASK A HUMAN TO DO WHAT AN AGENT COULD DO**. If you need to escalate, escalate. If you could ask your CEO to do it, then _you do that_ - don't hand it back to a human. Again: Never ask a human to do what an agent _could_ do. Rule number 1.
