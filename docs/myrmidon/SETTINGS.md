# Myrmidon settings

> Russian version: [SETTINGS.ru.md](SETTINGS.ru.md)

Our settings are environment variables `MYRMIDON_<AREA>_<NAME>`. Vendor `PAPERCLIP_*`
variables remain as they are and are not described here, except where we change their
meaning or default value.

**Default values:**

- defect fix enabled;
- deployment-specific values (windows, limits, addresses) are disabled or neutral.

Our production values live in the private `myrmidon-deploy`, not here.

A track writes only into its own section. A row is added in the same PR as the setting.

**Columns:**

- **Variable** — the name.
- **Function** — the function number (`P1`…).
- **Default** — the value when the variable is unset.
- **What it does** — in one phrase.
- **How to disable / special** — for example, "`0` — no limit".

## Track 1 — platform

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Track 2 — wake and run core

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS` | C0 | unset (disabled) | Ceiling of concurrent runs started by this server process: beyond it runs stay `queued`, the queue goes from oldest to newest. Counts runs of all agents of the process, not of one agent: the vendor only has a per-agent limit, and on 28.09 a mass wake started about 35 processes per container, the kernel killed the server together with all runs. A triggered limit schedules a repeat queue pass in 15 s instead of waiting for the next scheduler tick. The variable is the default at the FIRST start: afterwards the effective values are stored in settings (`instance_settings.general.runLimits`) and change on the fly on the Instance → General page ("Run limits") or via `GET`/`PATCH /api/myrmidon/runtime-limits` — the queue starts within a minute after the ceiling is raised, no server restart needed | Unset, empty, `0`, negative or non-numeric — the limit is off. Works together with the two variables below. An empty field in settings — the limit is off (same as `null` in `general.runLimits`); editing the DB row by hand takes effect after a restart |
| `MYRMIDON_MAX_RUN_STARTS_PER_MINUTE` | C0 | unset (disabled) | Ceiling of run starts over a sliding minute: a server restart or mass task approval does not start everything in one salvo. Unused reserved slots do not count. Default at first start, afterwards changed on the fly via settings (see the row above) | Unset, empty, `0`, negative or non-numeric — the limit is off |
| `MYRMIDON_MIN_FREE_MEMORY_MB` | C0 | unset (disabled) | A run starts only if after it the server cgroup (v2) retains this much free memory; each run is budgeted as `MYRMIDON_RUN_MEMORY_ESTIMATE_MB`, and runs started in the last 30 s are counted by budget until they have grown in the cgroup. Inactive page cache (`inactive_file`) counts as free | Unset, empty, `0`, negative or non-numeric — the limit is off. If the cgroup limit is not visible to the process (`memory.max` equals `max`, cgroup v1, process not in a container) — the memory check does not apply, and a warning `run admission cannot read the cgroup memory limit…` is written to the log once: then only the two variables above hold the ceiling. If the warning is present but the container limit is set — check how the server was started. Default at first start, afterwards changed on the fly via settings (see the `MYRMIDON_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS` row) |
| `MYRMIDON_RUN_MEMORY_ESTIMATE_MB` | C0 | `300` | How many megabytes are budgeted per run in the free-memory check. Default at first start, afterwards changed on the fly via settings (see the `MYRMIDON_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS` row); it cannot be disabled — free memory is computed from it | Unset, empty, `0`, negative or non-numeric — the default. In settings the field is required, `null` is not accepted |
| `MYRMIDON_STALE_LEASE_GRACE_MS` | P1 | `600000` (10 min) | How many milliseconds after a run finishes its active environment lease is left untouched by sweeping | Non-numeric or negative — the default. Sweeping cannot be disabled: this is a defect fix |
| `MYRMIDON_CONTINUATION_HISTORY_LIMIT` | P3 | `30` | How many newest entries of each task history list go into the run continuation context. The original and the last wake requests and comments are always preserved | `0` — no limit. Non-numeric or negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_DB_BACKUP_CATCHUP_WINDOW` | P11 | unset (disabled) | Enables catching up a missed dump at startup and anchoring the first scheduled tick to the newest dump. The value is the external backup window into which the catch-up and the first tick must not fall (they are shifted to its end) | Unset — vendor behavior. `none` — catch-up without a window. Window format: `<IANA-zone> HH:MM-HH:MM`, e.g. `UTC 01:00-01:15`; a window across midnight is allowed. An invalid value — catch-up disabled, a warning in the log |
| `MYRMIDON_SKIP_IDLE_HEARTBEATS` | M3 | off | A timer wake without a specific reason on an agent with no work does not start a run: the wake request is `skipped` with reason `heartbeat.timer.no_actionable_work` | `true`/`1`/`yes`/`on` — enable. Off — vendor behavior: skipping only for agents with `runtimeConfig.heartbeat.skipTimerWhenNoActionableWork` |
| `MYRMIDON_PENDING_INTERACTION_WAKE_GRACE_MS` | P12 | `600000` (10 min) | How many milliseconds a deferred wake of the card addressee waits before the sweeper resolves it: finalizes it `cancelled` if the card no longer awaits a reply, or re-admits it through normal admission if the task has no live run | `0` — resolve on the nearest tick; non-numeric or negative — the default value |
| `MYRMIDON_PENDING_INTERACTION_WAKE_RE_ADMISSIONS` | P12 | `1` | How many times the sweeper may re-admit one deferred wake while the addressee has not replied to the card; bounds the wake storm on a task | `0` — do not re-admit, only finalize; non-numeric — the default value |
| `MYRMIDON_PAUSE_DRAINS` | L3 | `1` (on) | An operator pause (`POST /agents/:id/pause`) does not cancel the agent's active runs — lets them finish. Cancellation still happens on a request with `cancelActive: true` or `?force=1` | `0`/`false`/`off`/`no` — restore vendor behavior (pause always cancels runs with code `agent_paused`). System pauses (budget, company archive, import) do not go through this route and are not affected by this setting. The same setting controls L3b: the stranded assigned-issue sweep does not escalate tasks of an agent on operator pause (`pause_reason = "manual"`); disabled — vendor escalation. Runs that a drained pause left to finish are stopped by a separate route `POST /api/myrmidon/agents/:id/emergency-stop` (L3b-ES): it does not depend on this setting and does not read it — see [guides/emergency-stop.md](guides/emergency-stop.md) |
| `MYRMIDON_PAUSE_RESUME_WAKE_BATCH` | L3 | `5` | How many stranded assigned tasks one batch wakes when the operator pause is lifted (`resumeAgentAfterPause`); promotion of the agent's already-queued runs is not batched | `0` — no batching: one batch for all tasks, as before this setting. Non-numeric — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_PAUSE_RESUME_WAKE_BATCH_PAUSE_MS` | L3 | `1000` | Pause between batches of stranded-task wakes when the pause is lifted | `0` — no pause (batching by `MYRMIDON_PAUSE_RESUME_WAKE_BATCH` remains). Non-numeric — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_OUTBOX_SWEEP_AGE_MS` | O1 | `45000` | The backup sweep pass of the continuation-wake outbox takes only intents older than the threshold: a just-created intent belongs to the direct post-commit delivery, an early sweep must not overtake it with a truncated envelope | `0` — immediate sweep (1.1.0 behavior). Non-numeric, negative or fractional — the default. Direct delivery (tryDeliver) is not bounded by the threshold |
| `MYRMIDON_PENDING_INTERACTION_WAKE_GRACE_MS` | P12 | `600000` (10 minutes) | How long a card wake parked for lack of an addressee waits after the last delivery before the backup pass resolves its receipt: the card is still answering, it must not be deferred; too early — the wake is extinguished before the addressee has time to accept it | Smaller — faster extinguishing with a silent addressee (coarser); `0` — resolution on the nearest scheduler tick. Non-numeric/negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_PENDING_INTERACTION_WAKE_RE_ADMISSIONS` | P12 | `1` | How many times the backup pass may re-admit a parked card wake (create a deferred run) against the same receipt while the card still awaits the addressee: the wake cannot storm the task every tick | `0` — re-admission disabled (the card waits only for direct delivery); larger — more retries with a silent addressee. The value is rounded down to an integer, non-numeric — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_IDLE_PICKUP_INTERVAL_SEC` | IDLE-PICKUP | `30` | How often (sec) the board itself wakes an agent with assigned `todo`/`in_progress` tasks and no live run: the top ready task by priority gets an `idle_pickup` wake bound to the task (issueId in context, without 403 cross-issue). A wake also fires right after a finished run releases the task execution lock. A ready task = without open blockers (`issue_relations` type `blocks` with an open blocker, including a cancelled one) and not a container (no open children). One run per pass; pause, maintenance mode, admission limits (C0), parallelism and agent daily ceilings are respected — checked by the wake admission path itself, not this pass | Values below 5 — 5. Non-numeric, `0`, negative or fractional — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_IDLE_PICKUP_ENABLED` | IDLE-PICKUP | `1` (on) | Master switch of auto-pickup: off — the board does not wake an idle agent with ready tasks (vendor behavior: only assignment, comment and timer) | `0`/`false`/`off`/`no` — disable (vendor behavior). Unset or unrecognized — enabled: a typo does not silently extinguish the fix |
| `MYRMIDON_IDLE_PICKUP_RECENT_SUCCESS_WINDOW_MS` | IDLE-PICKUP | `900000` (15 min) | How many milliseconds after a successful run on a task idle-pickup does not wake THIS SAME task: a fresh success without disposition is handled by vendor paths (successful-run-handoff, stranded-recovery) — they send an instructive wake, and a duplicate one creates a race. Other tasks of the agent are not delayed by this | `0` — suppression off (wake even after a fresh success). Non-numeric, negative or fractional — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_WORKSPACE_MERGED_COOLDOWN_MS` | WH-B | `1800000` (30 min) | A workspace whose branch is already merged (`deliveryState` = `merged_via_pr`/`merged_by_ancestry`) is archived after this short cooldown instead of the general terminal one (`PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_REAPER_COOLDOWN_DAYS`, 7 days) — merged workspaces do not linger on disk for a week. The "do not delete unpushed or dirty" protection is not weakened: such workspaces are not archived at any cooldown | `0` — archive on the next pass. Non-numeric or negative — the default of 30 min |
| `MYRMIDON_WORKSPACE_STUCK_SIGNAL_AFTER_MS` | WH-B | `86400000` (24 h) | A terminal workspace that the reaper cannot delete (dirty tree, unpushed or unconfirmed work) longer than this threshold writes a signal to the activity log (`execution_workspace.issue_terminal_archive_blocked`, actorId `workspace_terminality_reaper`); otherwise such workspaces are visible only in pass counters. Dedup — at most once a day per workspace, the fact is stored in the workspace `metadata` (no migration), the record contains no host paths | `0` — signal right after terminalization. Non-numeric or negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_HOST_GITHUB_CREDENTIALS` | S2-hostcred | unset (host mode off) | Emergency return of the vendor host mode for GitHub: the run again inherits host credentials (`GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `GIT_ASKPASS`, `GIT_SSH*`, `PAPERCLIP_GITHUB_HOST_HOME`, `GIT_CONFIG_*`) and talks to GitHub as the operator's account. By default the run takes the managed branch: the board issues the run token, `git`/`gh` launchers get credentials through the broker (secrets storage, access log entry) | Only exact `1` enables vendor host mode; as with L2, the value is not trimmed — `" 1"` and `"01"` do not count. Any other value (`true`, `yes`, `on`) and the absence of the variable — our behavior: a key from the host environment does not reach the run. Full closure (all GitHub calls through the storage and permissions) awaits S1-A and S6; until then the broker may rely on the server token |
| `MYRMIDON_RUN_STALL_ENABLED` | RUN-STALL | `1` (on) | Master switch of progress-based run liveness: off — a run whose own recorded progress stopped advancing is left running until the hard run timeout (vendor behavior) | `0`/`false`/`off`/`no` — disable (vendor behavior). Unset or unrecognized — enabled: a typo does not silently extinguish the fix |
| `MYRMIDON_RUN_STALL_THRESHOLD_SEC` | RUN-STALL | `1200` (20 min) | How long a running run may go without recorded progress (any appended run event, output flush, or useful action) before the sweep interrupts it as `run_stalled`: the task goes back to `todo` and its assignee is woken, so parts of the team-liveness work pick it up. Never a duration limit: a run working for hours with fresh progress is left alone | From 60 to 86400; values outside the range, non-numeric or fractional — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_RUN_STALL_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC` | RUN-STALL | `60` | Minimum spacing between two scan passes of the stall sweep; the scheduler queue itself ticks more often | Values below 15 or non-numeric or fractional — the default (60). The interrupt path itself is not rate limited by this |
| `MYRMIDON_RUN_STALL_PAGE_SIZE` | RUN-STALL | `50` | How many running runs one scan pass inspects at most, stalest progress first: the pass stays a bounded read of the runs table | From 1 to 200; values outside the range or non-numeric — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_STALE_BLOCK_ENABLED` | STALE-BLOCK | `0` (off) | Master switch of the stale-block watchdog: every `MYRMIDON_STALE_BLOCK_INTERVAL_SEC` it inspects blocked tasks and lifts a block whose every reason is dead (a blocker task `done` or `cancelled` — cancelled blockers never fire `issue_blockers_resolved` —, a passed `reasonRef.dueAt`, a cleared gate/event). The dead blocked-by edges are removed, the task returns to `in_progress`, and one system comment names the cause. Off (default) — vendor behavior: a dead reason holds the task blocked until a person intervenes | Only `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` enable; unset, `0`, unrecognized or a typo — off (an opt-in feature, a typo must not silently enable it) |
| `MYRMIDON_STALE_BLOCK_INTERVAL_SEC` | STALE-BLOCK | `300` (5 min) | Minimum spacing between two stale-block sweep passes; the scheduler queue itself ticks more often, the sweep keeps its own throttle | From 15 to 86400; values below 15, non-numeric or fractional — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_STALE_BLOCK_SIGNAL_TTL_MS` | STALE-BLOCK | `86400000` (24 h) | How long the attention-feed card "stale block lifted" stays on the desk after the watchdog unblocked a task: the card fades after the TTL, the task's system comment stays as the durable audit trail. The feed is computed on the fly from a process-local registry, so a server restart also clears the cards | `0` — the card is not shown at all. Non-numeric or negative — the default |

## Track 3 — tool gateway and Hermes adapter

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_HERMES_RUNTIME_MCP_URL_BASE` | P4 | unset — the gateway address is not changed (as with the vendor) | The origin of the `hermes_local` run MCP gateway address is replaced with this base address (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:3100`), path, query and token are preserved; only the origin pair is written to the log | Do not set. Per agent: `adapterConfig.runtimeMcpUrlBase` — its own base address, `adapterConfig.runtimeMcpUrlRewrite: false` — no rewriting. The field `adapterConfig.includeConfiguredMcpServers: false` — do not append servers from the profile into `-t` |
| `MYRMIDON_TOOL_BREAKER_FAILURES` | P9 | `3` | How many calls of one tool without a response (timeout, network, 5xx/408/429, non-JSON-RPC response) in the window put it on pause | `0` — breaker disabled |
| `MYRMIDON_TOOL_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_MS` | P9 | `60000` | Duration of the tool pause; after it one trial call passes | — |
| `MYRMIDON_TOOL_BREAKER_WINDOW_MS` | P9 | `600000` | Window in which failures of one tool are counted | — |
| `MYRMIDON_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MAX_MS` | P9 | `180000` | Ceiling of one tool call budget (vendor: 60 s) | — |
| `MYRMIDON_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SLOW_MS` | P9 | `45000` | Default budget for navigation tools (`navigate`, `goto`, `click`, `type`, `fill`, `press`, `reload`, `wait` in the name); the rest — 10 s, as with the vendor | At connection: `config.toolTimeouts` — budget by tool name |
| `MYRMIDON_WRITE_LOCK_REQUIRES_LIVE_RUN` | L5 | `1` | 409 `issue_write_assignee_run_lock` requires that the task's `checkoutRunId`/`executionRunId` point to a run in status `running`, `queued` or `scheduled_retry` (the vendor "non-terminal" trio, see `EXECUTION_PATH_HEARTBEAT_RUN_STATUSES`/`CANCELLABLE_HEARTBEAT_RUN_STATUSES`), not only at task status `in_progress` | `0`/`false` — the previous lock on `in_progress` status alone, run liveness is not checked. How to grant `tasks:manage_active_checkouts` (lock bypass) via config — `docs/myrmidon/design/issue-write-lock.md` |
| `MYRMIDON_CROSS_ISSUE_INFLUENCE_LIMIT` | P5 | `20` | Ceiling on the number of records of one run into tasks other than its own: comment, update, card decision; one counter per run | Unset, empty, non-numeric, `0`, negative or non-integer — the default of 20. The ceiling is a guard against record multiplication, there is no "no limit". Read on every record — no restart needed |

## Track 4 — chats and skills

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_TELEGRAM_DM_STATUS` | U1 | off | For a bridged Telegram DM (`MYRMIDON_TELEGRAM_DM_CONVERSATIONS`, X8b): the run gets one editable status message instead of milestone silence. `queued` and `working` coalesce into one durable status row (`run:<id>:dmstatus:<endpoint>`) — the delivery lane posts it once and edits the same provider message in place as the phase changes; the run's final answer replaces that message (the vendor's existing replace lane). Failure, admin-attention and completion milestones still publish as before, and the `/stop` terminal milestone stays suppressed (X8h) | Any value other than `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` — the vendor path unchanged: routine milestones stay suppressed in the bridged DM (X8h). Read on every sweep, no restart. Groups and topics are unaffected |
| `MYRMIDON_TELEGRAM_SPLIT_MAX_PARTS` | U1 | `0` (off) | How many parts a long structured Telegram answer may be split into inline, by paragraph/line/word boundaries, instead of the vendor's single `telegram_markdown_attachment` file. `0` keeps the vendor behavior byte for byte. Applies to answers the vendor already sends inline (plain prose) only for the structured case: plain-prose splitting continues to work without this setting | Unset, `0`, non-numeric or not a non-negative integer — the vendor's single attachment. Read at delivery time, no restart. Parts are capped: a document needing more parts stays an attachment |
| `MYRMIDON_TELEGRAM_FILE_LIMIT_BYTES` | P8 | unset — 25 MB (as with the vendor) | Ceiling on the size of a single file the Telegram adapter downloads, in bytes. For your own Bot API — up to `2147483648` (2 GB) | Unset, `0`, negative or non-numeric — the vendor's 25 MB. The effective limit is the lesser of this value and `PAPERCLIP_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES`; the cloud Bot API itself does not serve files over 20 MB. Read at adapter creation — a restart is needed after a change |
| `MYRMIDON_TELEGRAM_DM_CONVERSATIONS` | X8a/X8b/X8c/X8e | empty (off) | Comma-separated Telegram endpoint ids, or `*` — all. For enabled endpoints: the bot's DM becomes a permanent Agent Chat conversation (key `telegram:<user id>`), not a new `chat_channel` task per session (bridge X8b; also requires `enableAgentChat` enabled; read on every message, no restart); in this DM, OpenClaw-style commands work: `/help /new /model /think /stop /status /close /task` (X8c); Telegram shows the DM its own main command list (menu X8e: `setMyCommands`, scope `all_private_chats`; set when the bot connects or reconnects). Groups and topics are unaffected — they keep the previous vendor menu. The contract is X8a | Empty (unset, only whitespace or only commas) — the vendor path unchanged: no bridge, no commands, no Bot API calls beyond the vendor's (the private-chat menu is neither set nor removed). Set but the endpoint is not in the list — its DM follows the vendor path, and on the next bot connection its private-chat menu is removed (`deleteMyCommands`, scope `all_private_chats`); when an endpoint is removed the private-chat menu is always removed while the variable is non-empty. To give the bot back the vendor private-chat menu, reconnect the bot before clearing the variable, leaving someone else's id in it — a cleared variable does not itself remove the menu in Telegram. Parts X8b (#104), X8c (#103) and X8e (#101) merged together with this row |
| `MYRMIDON_CHAT_CROSS_CHANNEL_MESSAGES` | X8d | `12` | How many newest messages of the same person's adjacent conversation (web ↔ Telegram) with the same agent are quoted into the turn prompt | `0` — the digest is off. Non-numeric or negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_CHAT_CROSS_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_CHARS` | X8d | `600` | Truncation of one quoted message, characters, with a `[truncated]` mark | Non-numeric or negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_CHAT_CROSS_CHANNEL_TOTAL_CHARS` | X8d | `4000` | Total character limit on the quote block; the oldest lines are dropped first, the skipped counter is a `(k earlier messages not shown)` line | Non-numeric or negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_CHAT_CROSS_CHANNEL_LOOKBACK_HOURS` | X8d | `168` (a week) | How old adjacent-conversation messages are still quoted | Non-numeric or negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_CHAT_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS` | D1 | unset | Minimum interval between run-milestone sweep runs (`enqueueChatRunMilestones`); replaces the standard coalescing-trigger interval (100 ms) rather than adding to it. The publication sweep (delivering messages to the provider) is untouched — it keeps its usual pace | Unset, `0`, negative or non-numeric — today's pace (the fix of the D1 queries themselves is always on, this is not a defect switch). Set (e.g. `15000`) if after D1 the milestone sweep is still noticeable in load when chats are idle |
| `MYRMIDON_TELEGRAM_VOICE_STT` | 1.6.1 VOICE-STT B | off | Transcribe an inbound Telegram voice/audio message at intake: the bytes are prefetched (bounded, 20 MB, 45 s), recognized through the shared STT core (part A1) and the transcript is written into the task comment next to the kept attachment — the bot reads it as user input on the same wakeup. Speaker segments render as «Говорящий N [mm:ss]: …». An STT failure is a skip: the comment keeps the vendor body, the redacted `stt_skipped` code lands in the comment metadata, and the delivery is unaffected | Any value other than `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` — the vendor path byte for byte: no byte prefetch, zero calls to the transcription core. Read per delivery, no restart. Until the STT core is wired (part A1 merged and connected), an enabled setting records `stt_unconfigured` skips |

## Track 5 — operations

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_MAINTENANCE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SEC` | R3 | `900` | Maintenance-window drain timeout if the request has no `drainTimeoutSec` | `0` — immediate timeout; ceiling 86400 |
| `MAINTENANCE_ON_TIMEOUT` | DRAIN-INTERRUPT | `interrupt_and_retry` | Deploy-script setting (`deploy.env`): what the maintenance window does at the drain deadline. `interrupt_and_retry` drains for `MAINTENANCE_DRAIN_GRACE_SEC` and then interrupts the runs still going; each is retried when the window closes, so a planned deploy does not wait for long runs. Read by `scripts/myrmidon/deploy/{lib,deploy}.sh`, not by the server | `wait` — keep admission closed and wait out `MAINTENANCE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SEC` (the behaviour before drain-interrupt). Any other value — the deploy refuses before it touches anything |
| `MAINTENANCE_DRAIN_GRACE_SEC` | DRAIN-INTERRUPT | `300` | Deploy-script setting (`deploy.env`): how long the window drains before it interrupts the remaining runs (the `drainTimeoutSec` of the enter request in interrupt mode) | Ignored with `MAINTENANCE_ON_TIMEOUT=wait`, which uses `MAINTENANCE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SEC` |
| `MYRMIDON_MAINTENANCE_TICK_SEC` | R3 | `5` | How often the mode service recomputes windows: `entering → on`, timeouts, exit completion | From 1 to 3600 |
| `MYRMIDON_MAINTENANCE_CACHE_TTL_SEC` | R3 | `5` | How many seconds the admission gateway caches maintenance windows and the org structure (department membership) | `0` — no cache, DB read on every check. Transitions made by this process are visible at once |
| `MYRMIDON_MAINTENANCE_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` | R3 | `15000` | Upper bound for one maintenance integration hook call (`onEntered`/`onExited`, the Zabbix client). A hook that exceeds it is abandoned (it keeps running detached) and the window lifecycle continues; the timeout is logged and audited. OPE-3638: a hung `onExited` pinned `leaving` windows until every card change on the agent was blocked | From 1000 to 300000; a value outside the range falls back to the default |
| `MYRMIDON_ZABBIX_URL` | R3 | unset | Address of the Zabbix API (`…/api_jsonrpc.php`) for the instance maintenance window | Unset — the integration is off, no calls |
| `MYRMIDON_ZABBIX_TOKEN_REF` | R3 | unset | Reference to the Zabbix API token: `env:<NAME>` (variable) or `file:<path>` (a file, e.g. a Docker secret). The value is not logged | Unset — the integration is off |
| `MYRMIDON_ZABBIX_HOST_GROUPS` | R3 | unset | Comma-separated names of Zabbix host groups that are put into maintenance when the instance window is entered | Unset — the integration is off |
| `MYRMIDON_ZABBIX_MAX_WINDOW_SEC` | R3 | `14400` | Length of the Zabbix maintenance period; if the exit never happens, Zabbix closes the period itself | — |
| `MYRMIDON_SETTLED_HOLDS_BLOCK_EXPLICIT_WAKES` | L2 | `0` (off) | Restores vendor behavior: a settled (resolved/cancelled) resolution record with `evidence.automaticRecovery.replay = "blocked"` blocks even explicitly human-authorized wakes (comment, assignment, on_demand/manual, unpause, interaction), not only an automatic retry of the same run; a wake also does not cancel the same agent's run waiting in the queue (this cancellation is needed only when bypassing the lock, PR #91 review round 3). "Explicitly authorized" — only `requestedByActorType: "user"` (PR #91 review round 1: an automated collector with the same `reason`/`source` as a human — does not count) | `1` — enable (vendor behavior). Any other value or the absence of the variable — off (our default behavior: the lock passes explicitly human-authorized wakes and is replaced by them) |
| `MYRMIDON_STRANDED_AUTO_RETRIES_PER_DAY` | L4 | `2` | How many times over a sliding 24 hours `escalateStrandedAssignedIssue` sends the assignee a continuation asking to set the outcome before handing the task to `in_review` of the direct manager (`agents.reportsTo`) instead of a card to the owner. Counts only reasons `stranded_assigned_issue`/`successful_run_missing_state` with a successful last run. Only for `stranded_assigned_issue` is it exactly N attempts; for `successful_run_missing_state` the vendor `successful-run-handoff.ts` already sends its own (not ours, without our mark) correcting run before the task even reaches this counter — in total for this reason it comes to up to N+1 attempts, not exactly N (see `DIVERGENCE.md`, `L4`) | `0` — straight to the manager (if there is none or inactive — vendor escalation to the owner, unchanged). Non-numeric or negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_STRANDED_AUTOPOLICY_ENABLED` | L4 | `true` | Master switch of the whole L4 policy (steps 1 and 2 from the row above) — a quick rollback during an incident without a code change and without removing `reportsTo` from agents | `false` or `0` — straight to vendor escalation to the owner unchanged, `MYRMIDON_STRANDED_AUTO_RETRIES_PER_DAY` is not read. Unset or unrecognized — enabled (a typo does not silently extinguish the protection) |
| `MYRMIDON_ACCESS_HUB_ENABLED` | SEC1 | `false` | Включает раздел «Доступы»: API `/api/myrmidon/access-hub/*` (типизация секретов, генерация ssh-ключей, реестр хостов, журнал, выдача/отзыв доступов). Выключен — чтения отвечают `enabled: false`, мутации 409, хранилище не трогается | `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` — включить. Значение выката задаётся отдельно, в закрытом `myrmidon-deploy` |
| `MYRMIDON_ACCESS_HUB_SSH_TIMEOUT_MS` | SEC1 | `30000` | Потолок времени одной ssh-операции access-hub (deploy/revoke/dryRun: чтение и запись authorized_keys) на один хост, включая connect и drain команды; по истечении процесс ssh завершается, операция отвечает `not_deployed` с человеческой причиной (значений ключа в ней нет) | Нечисловое, меньше 1000 или больше 300000 — умолчание |
| `MYRMIDON_ACCESS_HUB_SSH_ADMIN_KEY_SECRET` | SEC1 | не задана | Имя существующего секрета компании (админский root-ключ), значением которого доска ходит по ssh на хосты реестра при раскладке/отзыве ключей. Не задана — ssh-операции отвечают `not_deployed` с причиной «admin ssh key secret is not configured», остальной access-hub работает | Имя секрета; значением должен быть приватный ключ в PEM (PKCS#8). Значение секрета не логируется и не возвращается |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_ENABLED` | R5-A | `0` (off) | Allows board deploys from the UI: without it write routes answer 503, reads work | `1` — enable. The default is off |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_HEALTH_URL` | R5-A | unset | Address of the board's own `/api/health` as the board container sees it: the job uses it to verify the version/commit after the switch | Unset — the final health check is impossible, the job will not close as successful |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_REPORTS_DIR` | R5-A | unset | Directory of host-runner reports (the deploy `$STATE_DIR`), mounted into the board container read-only | Unset — the board does not see runner reports, the job does not move past `maintenance_on` |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_STEP_TIMEOUT_SEC` | R5-A | `1800` | How many seconds a job may stand in one status before it cancels itself and closes the window | From 10 to 86400 |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_TICK_SEC` | R5-A | `5` | How often the job service reconciles state with the maintenance window, the runner report and health | From 1 to 3600 |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_SEC` | R5-A | `30` | Timeout of network digest checks (registry, GitHub) at job creation and preview | From 1 to 300 |
| `MYRMIDON_RELEASE_COMPONENTS` | RELEASE-GATE | `dockergate,fleetd` | Which release components `deploy.sh` rolls together with the board in one run (the 01.10 incident: the board moved, dockergate stayed). Digest resolution order: the `myr-vX.Y.Z` tag from the board image version label, else the `sha-<short sha>` tag of its commit. A release whose components are missing from the registry is refused before anything changes | `none` — deploy the board alone (not for a release: the incident was exactly that split). Components as a comma list; known names: `dockergate`, `fleetd` |
| `MYR_DOCKERGATE_HEALTH_URL` | RELEASE-GATE | unset | REQUIRED health probe of dockergate in the joint rollout: the value goes to curl verbatim (URL + arguments, e.g. `--unix-socket /run/myrmidon-dockergate/engine.sock http://localhost/_ping`) | Unset — the component rollout refuses after the switch (fail-closed): no success is reported without a check |
| `MYR_FLEETD_HEALTH_URL` | RELEASE-GATE | unset | The same for fleetd (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/bots` with the auth header) | Unset — refuses after the switch, like dockergate |
| `MYR_DOCKERGATE_COMPOSE_SERVICE` / `MYR_DOCKERGATE_OVERRIDE_FILE` | RELEASE-GATE | `dockergate` / `docker-compose.myrmidon-dockergate.yml` | Service name and override file of dockergate in `$COMPOSE_DIR` when an installation differs | Override variables; for fleetd the same with `FLEETD` |
| `MYR_DOCKERGATE_HOST` / `MYR_FLEETD_HOST` | RELEASE-GATE (02.10 follow-ups) | `local` | Where the component actually runs: `local` — this host's compose project (the rollout proves the service is part of it via `docker compose config --services` and refuses before pulling or writing anything when it is not, fail-closed); `remote:<user>@<host>` — the service runs on another host (fleetd on the second host): docker/compose through ssh (key auth), the override is written there, the health URL is probed from the deploy host; `skip` — the component is not managed by this deploy (its own procedure rolls it out elsewhere), the rollout logs a loud SKIP and still CI-checks the digest | The 1.4.0 rollout created `paperclip-fleetd-1` on the board host (no config there, exited, removed by hand): point fleetd at the host it really runs on |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_SMOKE` | RELEASE-GATE | `1` (on) | Post-deploy smoke: within the timeout at least one bot container must re-apply (its status is `running`), else the deploy reports DEGRADED and prints the rollback commands | `0` — the smoke does not run at all (not for a release) |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_SMOKE_COMPANY` | RELEASE-GATE | unset | UUID of the company whose agents the smoke polls (the agents list is per-company) | Unset — the smoke is skipped with a warning in the `deploy.sh` output |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_SMOKE_AGENT` | RELEASE-GATE | unset | UUID of one specific agent for the smoke instead of polling all bots of the company | Unset — all `hermes_gateway` agents of the company are polled |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_SMOKE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | RELEASE-GATE | `300` | How long the smoke waits for a bot container to re-apply (the incident asked for 5 minutes) | From 10 to 1800 |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_SMOKE_INTERVAL_SEC` | RELEASE-GATE | `10` | Poll interval of the container statuses in the smoke | From 1 to 60 |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_HEALTH_POLL_SEC` | R5-A | `5` | Reserved: health poll interval in the verification phase | From 1 to 300 |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_HEALTH_TIMEOUT_SEC` | R5-A | `300` | Reserved: budget of the health verification phase | From 10 to 3600 |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_REGISTRY_INSPECT_URL` | R5-A | unset | Read-only inspect endpoint of the registry for digest verification, answers `?ref=<reference>` with JSON like `imagetools inspect`; for cases when the board container cannot see ghcr.io | Unset — the board reads ghcr.io directly |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_GITHUB_HEADERS_JSON` | R5-A | unset | JSON object of headers for GitHub API calls at commit verification (for rate limits); values are not logged | Unset — anonymous calls |
| `MYRMIDON_BUILD_DATE` | ABOUT | unset | Build date of the image shown in "About Myrmidon" (Instance → General and the sidebar footer): the image CI passes it as a build argument to the `Dockerfile`. Non-ISO or non-date value — the `buildDate` field of `GET /api/myrmidon/about` stays `null` | Unset or wrong format — the field is hidden, a local build without a stamp |
| `MYRMIDON_BASE_PAPERCLIP` | ABOUT | unset | Release of the vendor Paperclip base (e.g. `2026.916.1`) the image was cut from: the image CI passes it as a build argument; shown in "About Myrmidon" next to the Myrmidon version | Unset or a format other than `YYYY.N.N` — the `basePaperclipVersion` field stays `null` |
| `MYRMIDON_IMAGE_DIGEST` | ABOUT | unset | Digest of the running image (`sha256:…`) when the deployment pinned it (a full reference of the form `repo@sha256:…` is also accepted — the digest is taken after the `@`). Shown in "About Myrmidon" | Unset or not `sha256:<64 hex>` — the `imageDigest` field stays `null` |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_AUTO_ROLLBACK` | R5-C | `1` (on) | Health-based automatic rollback of the board: when the post-deploy health check fails, the host executor immediately runs the same `rollback.sh` against the locally remembered previous image (the emergency path: the CI check of the rollback target only warns), the job ends `auto_rolled_back` with the window closed; a failed rollback itself ends `failed_rollback`, the window stays on for the operator | `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` — the old contract: `failed_health`, the window stays on, the rollback is manual. The host side of the same switch is `AUTO_ROLLBACK` in deploy.env; both sides must agree |
| `MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_AUTO_UPDATE` | R5-C | `0` (off) | Allows board deploys without a confirmation in the interface. While off (the default) every deploy waits for an explicit human confirmation. Enable only after the release scenario has run on the staging stand (STAND, 1.1.2): auto-update without a stand is the risk the plan names | `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` — enable (not before the STAND run) |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_LANGFUSE_URL` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | Deploy-script setting (`deploy.env`), read by `scripts/myrmidon/deploy/tracing-check.sh`, which `deploy.sh` runs as step 7b/8: base URL of the Langfuse server. The check reads the public route `GET /api/public/health`, whose `version` is the v4 marker (v4 in `events_only` mode rejects the legacy `/api/public/ingestion`); the probe needs no credentials | Unset together with every other `MYRMIDON_TRACING_*` setting — the check logs a skip and the deploy continues. Set — the callback set must be verifiable, otherwise the check refuses |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_LANGFUSE_VERSION` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | The Langfuse version pinned in the release bundle: the documented fallback when the health route is unreachable, guarded or answers without a version. A legacy `langfuse` callback with an unproven version is refused as well (a silent install is the incident this check exists for) | Unset with an unreadable probe — the version stays unproven and a legacy callback is refused. Not the same value as the Langfuse image tag |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_GATEWAY_CONFIG` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | Path of the deployed LiteLLM gateway config: the `callbacks:` list under `litellm_settings:` is read as one of the effective callback sources (inline `[a, b]` and block `- a` forms) | Unset together with the command below — the check refuses: the effective set cannot be read, and nothing is assumed clean |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_CALLBACKS_COMMAND` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | Deploy-script setting: command printing the effective callbacks of the live gateway (or its database), one per line or comma/space separated. Read together with the config file and the union is checked, because the file and the gateway database disagree and the database only adds callbacks | Unset together with the config file — refuses like above. To stop checking tracing at all, unset every `MYRMIDON_TRACING_*` setting |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_CALLBACKS_FILE` | TRACING-HEALTH | `$STATE_DIR/tracing-callbacks.txt` | The generated file with the callback list the bundle installs — the ONE source of truth, written from `tracing_intended_callbacks()` in `lib.sh` (`tracing-check.sh --write-intended`); the check reads the same file | Missing file — the function itself answers. The file is never a hand-written second list: the gateway config and the check are rendered from it |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_TOKEN_FILE` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | Token file for a Langfuse deployment whose health route is behind auth. The value is not logged | Unset — the probe is anonymous |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_DELIVERY_COMMAND` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | Deploy-script setting: command printing two integers for the delivery window — the OTEL event count in `events_core` (ClickHouse) and the LiteLLM SpendLogs request count. The installer sends a test request and waits for an event, so **zero events with traffic is a refusal, not a silent success**; a delivery ratio below 50 % and unreadable counts are refused too. The window is exported to the command as `MYRMIDON_TRACING_DELIVERY_WINDOW_SEC` | Unset — the delivery check is skipped with a log line. Part C measures the same ratio live on the board, same semantics |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_DELIVERY_WINDOW_SEC` | TRACING-HEALTH | `900` (15 min) | The window those two counts cover, in seconds, and the value the delivery command receives | Unset or empty — the default. The value is passed to the delivery command as-is; no validation is performed |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_LANGFUSE_IMAGE` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | Image reference of the Langfuse server the bundle pins: it must carry a full `X.Y.Z` tag or a digest. A major or minor tag (for example `langfuse/langfuse:4`) moves under the deployment and is not a pin | Unset — the pin check is skipped. Set to a major/minor tag, `latest` or an untagged name — refused |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_GATEWAY_IMAGE` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | The same pin rule for the gateway (LiteLLM) image of the bundle: full `X.Y.Z` tag or digest | Unset — skipped; anything that is not a full version or a digest — refused |

## Track 6 — security and models

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_RUN_ENV_ALLOW` | S2 | empty | Additional names of server environment variables (comma-separated, without values) that are passed into the run process beyond the base list | Base list: `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `SHELL`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `TZ`, `TERM`, `TMPDIR`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `SSL_CERT_DIR`, `HTTP(S)_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` (and lowercase), Windows: `SYSTEMROOT`, `WINDIR`, `COMSPEC`, `PATHEXT`. Non-secret server pointers: `PAPERCLIP_RUNTIME_API_URL`, `PAPERCLIP_LISTEN_HOST`, `PAPERCLIP_LISTEN_PORT`, `PAPERCLIP_RUNTIME_API_CANDIDATES_JSON`. CLI directory pointers: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `CURSOR_HOME`, `GROK_HOME`, `HERMES_HOME`, `KIMI_CODE_HOME`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. Plus the credential variables of the adapter's own provider (`MYRMIDON_RUN_ENV_PROVIDER_ALLOW` in `myrmidon-run-env.ts`): `claude_local` — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`; `codex_local` — `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; `cursor` — `CURSOR_API_KEY`; `gemini_local` — `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`; `grok_local` — `XAI_API_KEY`; `kimi_local` — `KIMI_API_KEY`, `KIMI_MODEL_API_KEY`; `opencode_local` — `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; `pi_local` — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`; `hermes_local` — `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `KIMI_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, `ZAI_API_KEY`. Full inheritance — only via the agent flag `adapterConfig.inheritProcessEnv: true` |

## WORKSPACE-HYGIENE — shared pnpm store for workspaces

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_WORKSPACE_PNPM_STORE_DIR` | WORKSPACE-HYGIENE | unset — `<repository root>/.paperclip/pnpm-store` | Absolute path of the shared pnpm store into which `provision-worktree.sh` installs packages and from which they are imported into the workspace `node_modules` with hard links (`--config.package-import-method=hardlink`): one store for all workspaces of one repository instead of a full copy of packages per branch. The repository root is taken from `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_REPO_ROOT` (then `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_BASE_CWD`) — the default path lies on the same volume as the workspaces, so hardlink import works | A relative path in this variable is resolved from the same anchor. Store and workspace on different filesystems — installation falls back to vendor behavior (pnpm's own default store) with a warning to stderr |
| `MYRMIDON_WORKSPACE_PNPM_STORE` | WORKSPACE-HYGIENE | `1` (enabled) | Master switch of the shared store: `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` — `provision-worktree.sh` runs `pnpm install` with vendor argv without store flags | Disabling returns the previous disk usage (a full copy of `node_modules` per workspace) |
## P12 — the deferred addressee-wake sweeper

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_PENDING_INTERACTION_WAKE_GRACE_MS` | P12 | `600000` (10 min) | Waiting window of an addressee-wake request (`interaction-pending:<card>`): while the window has not expired, the sweeper does not touch the request on a task with a live run; on expiry the request is resolved (finalized or re-admitted through the normal admission path). An invalid value falls back to the default | A value below zero — as the default; the sweeper itself is limited to 50 requests per scheduler tick |
| `MYRMIDON_PENDING_INTERACTION_WAKE_RE_ADMISSIONS` | P12 | `1` | How many times the sweeper may re-admit an addressee-wake request (create the addressee's run queue with the saved card context); afterwards the request is finalized `cancelled` with a reason | `0` — no re-admissions, the request is resolved on the very first pass |

## L1 — infrastructure interruptions

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_INFRA_INTERRUPT_CODES` | L1 | `agent_paused,process_lost,server_shutdown_interrupted,issue_reassigned` | List of run error codes (comma-separated) for which `legacyExecutionNeedsReconciliation` does not set the `legacy_execution_requires_reconciliation` lock, an agent pause does not escalate the task immediately, and the periodic stranded-task resolution does not escalate it while the agent is merely paused — all within the shared retry budget (2, the same as the rest of the function's content) and **only when the run was claimed by a conversation adapter** (`CONVERSATION_ADAPTER_TYPES`, `conversation-continuation.ts`) **or an adapter with its own idempotency key** (`IDEMPOTENT_INFRA_INTERRUPT_ADAPTER_TYPES`, currently empty; `hermes_gateway` is relieved through the conversation-adapter route instead — its own predecessor overlap guard stops a still-live previous run before creating a new one, so it needs no idempotency key of its own) — and only while the provider stop is not in the "requested, unconfirmed" state (`resultJson.executionCancellation.state === 'requested'`: the vendor lock remains). For the rest (`process`, `http`, `openclaw_gateway`, unknown adapter) this list of codes does not apply — the vendor lock remains, their run must not be retried blindly (risk of executing an external action twice) | Empty or `off` — vendor behavior (the lock is always set). A custom list replaces the default entirely, does not add to it. The adapter filter cannot be disabled by the list itself |

## G1 — bot container image (bot runtime image)

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_YOLO` | G1 | `1` (enabled) | The `docker/bot-runtime` image: `1` is translated into `HERMES_YOLO_MODE=1` for the `hermes gateway run` process — approvals on dangerous commands are skipped, because this gateway has no connected human who could answer the request | `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` — approvals follow `approvals.mode` in the profile's `config.yaml` (hermes default is `smart`); on unmanaged platforms (`api_server` — this case) unanswered approvals default to `deny`. Useful only for a testbed where someone can answer |

## Vendor settings that matter for Myrmidon

Here are the vendor switches you need to know when deploying Myrmidon: for example, how
to enable plan mode (X2). Tracks fill it in, the section is shared.

| Where | What | Value for Myrmidon | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task: the `workMode` field (`POST/PATCH /api/issues…`, `"planning"`); in the UI — the "Plan mode" toggle in the task input field | Task plan mode: the wake prompt gets a `planning directive` — the agent only composes or updates a plan, does not write code. After the plan is accepted — only child tasks | Works with `hermes_local` without changes: plan directives reach the run prompt (test `server/src/__tests__/hermes-planning-mode.myrmidon.test.ts`). Enabled per task, no separate instance switch needed | X2 |
| `PATCH /api/instance/settings/experimental`: `enableIssuePlanDecompositions` (in the UI — Instance Settings → Experimental, "Task Plan Decomposition") | Shows on the task page the history of accepted-plan decomposition into child tasks | Optional, off by default. Does not affect plan-mode work in the run | X2 |
| `PATCH /api/instance/settings/experimental`: `enableFirstTaskPlanProposal` ("First task: propose with a plan document") | For the first single task of a new organization the manager writes a short plan document and a card with options instead of one confirmation card | Optional, off by default. Applies only to organizations created after enabling | X2 |
| `PATCH /api/instance/settings/experimental`: `enableMyrmidonUi2` (in the UI — Instance Settings → Experimental, "Myrmidon UI 2.0 Shell") | Renders the board route tree in the Myrmidon 2.0 frame (rail, top bar, phone bottom bar); pages, routes, data and access stay shared with the 1.x shell. Fails closed: off while loading, on a read error, and for stored rows written before the flag existed. A per-browser `?ui=1|2` override (localStorage `myr.ui2.personal`) wins over the flag in both directions | Off by default; apply and revert on the next page load, no restart. Guide: [guides/ui2-shell.md](guides/ui2-shell.md) | UI-2.0 |
| `TELEGRAM_API_BASE_URL` | Bot API address for the Telegram adapter (vendor variable) | Address of your own Bot API if files larger than 20 MB are needed; unset — cloud Bot API | P8 |
| `PAPERCLIP_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` | Overall board attachment size limit (vendor, 10 MB by default) | Also limits Telegram files: raise together with `MYRMIDON_TELEGRAM_FILE_LIMIT_BYTES` | P8 |
| Instance configuration file, `telemetry.enabled` | Telemetry flag. Vendor default is `true`, ours is `false` | Do not enable. Enabling also requires `PAPERCLIP_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` (your own ingestion address) | TEL |
| `PAPERCLIP_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` | Telemetry ingestion address. With us, telemetry does not work without it even with the flag, there are no default addresses | Do not set | TEL |
| `PAPERCLIP_ANNOUNCEMENTS_ENABLED`, `PAPERCLIP_ANNOUNCEMENTS_FEED_URL` | Announcement feed. The vendor has it enabled by default with the vendor address; with us it is enabled only by `PAPERCLIP_ANNOUNCEMENTS_ENABLED=true` plus your own feed address | Do not set | TEL |
| `PAPERCLIP_FEEDBACK_EXPORT_BACKEND_URL` (or `PAPERCLIP_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_URL`) | Where feedback the user chose to share goes. With us there is no default address: without it feedback stays local, the export is marked "not configured" | Do not set | TEL |
| `PAPERCLIP_UPDATE_CHECK_URL` | Address where the CLI checks for a new version (npm registry response format). The vendor — `registry.npmjs.org/paperclipai` always; with us, without the variable there is no check | Do not set | TEL |
| `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_REAPER_COOLDOWN_DAYS` | Terminal cooldown of the workspace reaper (vendor, 7 days). With WH-B it no longer determines the term for merged workspaces: a workspace with a merged branch goes to the archive by `MYRMIDON_WORKSPACE_MERGED_COOLDOWN_MS` (30 min). The reaper does not delete unmerged workspaces anyway (unpushed protection), so in practice the variable now prolongs the life of no archivable workspace; kept as a vendor fallback | May be left unset | WH-B |

## Bot containers (G-series, the 28.09 "option B" plan)

Settings of the pilot local container driver (`server/src/myrmidon/bot-containers/`).
Decision register — `containers-plan-senior-2026-09-28.md`.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINERS` | G3 | off | Enables bot container reconciliation: both the periodic pass (`startBotContainerReconciliation`) and "apply now" for one agent (`applyBotContainerNow`) | `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` — enable. Disabled — both entries do nothing (`applyBotContainerNow` returns `not_applicable`), and at server startup no driver is created and the agents table is not read. Enabled — at server startup (`startBotContainers`, W2a) the runtime is assembled and the pass starts; this happens in the process where the wake scheduler is enabled, in another process "apply now" answers 503. A runtime that cannot be assembled (e.g. `MYRMIDON_BOT_VOLUME_ROOT` is unset) is written to the server log as an error, the pass does not start, the board works. Enable only after running the full cycle on a testbed with real Docker and a bot image that declares the contract (see `MYRMIDON_BOT_IMAGE_ALLOWLIST`) |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_DOCKER_SOCKET` | G3 | `/var/run/docker.sock` | Unix socket of the Docker Engine through which the local driver (`docker-driver.ts`) talks to the daemon | On a production host — the dockergate socket `/run/myrmidon-dockergate/engine.sock` (a proxy with an allowlist of calls, see [dockergate.md](dockergate.md)); the raw daemon socket is not mounted into the board: access to it equals host root for any process with the board's uid. The default is suitable only for a testbed without terminal bots. Read at server startup (W2a) |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_IMAGE_ALLOWLIST` | G3 | empty (nothing allowed) | Comma-separated list of images that may be launched as a bot container; `*` does not cross `/` | Without a value `create()`/`recreate()` refuse to create any container — this is a deliberate fail-closed, not a defect. The image must already lie on the host: the driver does not pull it. In addition, the image must declare the bot environment contract with the label `myrmidon.bot-runtime.contract=1` (including: it takes `API_SERVER_KEY` and other secrets from `$HERMES_HOME/.env`, does not require them from the container environment); an image without the label or with a different version is rejected before anything is created |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_VOLUME_ROOT` | G3 | unset (required) | Directory on the host under which bot volumes live: `<root>/<botKey>/{hermes,workspace,scratch}` | Without a value `dockerBotContainerDriver()` (without an explicit config) throws an exception when the driver is used |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_MOUNT_SOURCES` | BOT-VOLUMES | empty (nothing allowed) | Comma-separated list of absolute host directories that a card may mount to a bot as an additional volume (`adapterConfig.container.extraMounts`) — read-only only. A source not in the list is rejected before Docker is called; only a directory named here in full can be mounted (exact match, no prefix rule), and the mount point inside the container cannot occupy `/data/hermes`, `/workspace`, `/scratch`, `/tmp` or a path under them. The directory does not have to be under `MYRMIDON_BOT_VOLUME_ROOT` | Empty or unset — no additional volume is allowed (fail-closed). Read once at server startup (W2a); a change requires a board server restart. After the restart, a bot whose mount set no longer matches its card is recreated (the bind list is part of the container template). dockergate calls the same list `mountSources` (see [dockergate.md](dockergate.md)); on the dockergate side the change applies without a restart, via `SIGHUP` |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_NETWORK` | G3 | `myrmidon-bots` | The only docker network a bot container joins; a card cannot specify another | — |
| `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_BASE_URL` | M2-A | unset (off) | Address of the LLM gateway (OpenAI-compatible, e.g. LiteLLM) from which the board server assembles the spend log and model prices: `http(s)://…`, read at startup and at every collection pass. The address is not stored in the open repository — the value is set by the deployment | Set together with `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_KEY_SECRET`; without both, collection is off: the periodic pass does not start, and `/api/myrmidon/…/litellm/*` answers 503 `enabled: false`, and the Costs "Gateway" tab writes "collection is not enabled" |
| `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_KEY_SECRET` | M2-A | unset (off) | Name of the company secret holding the gateway key with access to `/spend/logs/v2` and `/v1/model/info` (for LiteLLM this is a virtual key with the right to read the spend log) | The value is read only for the duration of the pass, is not written to the log and is not stored; spend rows are attributed to agents by sha256 of bot key values — the values themselves do not leave the process |
| `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_COST_INTERVAL_SEC` | M2-A | `300` | Collection pass period (in seconds): reads `/spend/logs/v2` since the last collected event (first pass — a 24 h window), refreshes the model catalog `/v1/model/info` | From 30 to 86400; non-integer or out of bounds — `300` is taken. An overlapping pass skips the tick instead of queueing up |
| `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_FIRST_LOOKBACK_DAYS` | HERMES-USAGE-COST | `1` | How far back a FIRST collection pass reads when nothing has been collected yet: the whole unpriced month can be collected by setting this to its length in days. After the pass, the reconcile step fills the unpriced `hermes_gateway` rows of the vendor cost ledger with the collected prices, so the dashboard and Costs screens stop showing $0 | From 1 to 90; non-integer or out of bounds — `1` is taken. A one-off backfill can instead pin the window start with `POST /api/myrmidon/companies/:id/litellm/sweep` body `{ "from": "2026-10-01" }` (board only) |
| `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_ADMIN_KEY_SECRET` | M2-B | unset (key management off) | Name of the company secret holding the gateway ADMIN key (for LiteLLM — the master key): it manages the agents' virtual keys and is never handed to an agent. It is used only to read key names and to issue or rotate one agent's key; the value is not written to the log. Without it, together with `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_BASE_URL`, the keys API answers 503 `enabled: false` | — |
| `MYRMIDON_BUDGET_SIGNAL_MODE` | M3 | on | When a budget hard-stop is reached, the owner gets a signal: a system-notice comment in the thread of every open issue the stop interrupted (cause, limit, observed spend, how to continue — raise the budget or keep the scope paused), written once per incident per issue. Without this the stop is silent in the issue thread: runs are cancelled and queued wakeups dropped, and the only trace is the decision inbox card the owner must open on their own | `off` (case-insensitive) — disable the signal entirely; any other value or unset — on. The vendor pause/cancel/incident mechanics are not affected by this switch, only the delivery of the signal |
| `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_AGENT_KEY_ENV` | M2-B | unset | Name of the environment variable in which the bot profile compiler substitutes THIS agent's key (`llm.apiKeyEnv` of the resulting `config.yaml`): the key comes from the agent's secret rather than from a single company-wide value, so spend arrives in the gateway log under the agent's key. Unset — the previous behaviour. The name may not be `HOME`, `PATH`, `HERMES_HOME`, `API_SERVER_KEY`, `PAPERCLIP_API_URL`, `PAPERCLIP_API_KEY`; an invalid name reads as "not set" | — |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_EGRESS_MODE` | EGRESS-A | `off` | Mode of bot egress to the outside. `off` — as before, no proxy variables in the profile; `log` — the bot container gets the fleet proxy address, all outbound traffic is visible in the proxy log, nothing is blocked (see [egress.md](egress.md)) | A value other than `off` and `log` — an error, the profile is not assembled (a typo must not look like "left as it was"), as is `log` without `MYRMIDON_BOT_EGRESS_PROXY`. Read at every profile build; changing the value restarts bot containers (`.env` is a "restart"-class file), no board restart needed |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_EGRESS_PROXY` | EGRESS-A | unset | Address of the outbound proxy as the bot container sees it (`http://egress-proxy:3128`); goes into `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` in `hermes/.env`, the address's user is the bot key (by it the proxy names the bot in the log) | Required with `MYRMIDON_BOT_EGRESS_MODE=log`; only an `http://` URL is accepted (the proxy speaks plain HTTP and tunnels TLS via `CONNECT`) — otherwise the profile is not assembled |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_EGRESS_NO_PROXY` | EGRESS-A | unset | Comma-separated hosts the bot visits directly, bypassing the proxy; `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1` and the `MYRMIDON_BOT_BOARD_URL` host are always added to them | Empty — only the built-in list. Patterns (`*`) are supported by none of the usual clients: a host is specified exactly |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_EGRESS_TOKEN` | EGRESS-B | unset | Shared token of the board and the proxy: the proxy presents it when fetching the allowlists (`GET /api/myrmidon/bot-egress/policy`), and the board — when reading the proxy refusal feed | Unset — the board gives the lists to no one (503), the proxy remains only a log: this is the "EGRESS-B not enabled" state. Comparison is constant-time value-to-value; the token is a secret, not stored in the repository or settings |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_EGRESS_REFUSALS_URL` | EGRESS-B | unset | Address of the proxy as the board sees it (`http://<proxy>:3128`); the board reads `/refusals` through it and shows the latest refusals in the "Egress" section of the project | Unset — the refusal feed answers 503, lists and blocking work. Long-term refusal storage is the proxy log (`docker logs`), the feed is only a tail for the UI. Read on every request |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_SEC` | W2a | `60` | How often (in seconds) the pass reconciles containers of all bots with their cards: `hermes_gateway` agents with `adapterConfig.container.enabled`, except terminated ones | From 5 to 3600; empty, non-integer or out of bounds — `60` is taken. Read at server startup, a change requires a restart. The pass runs one at a time: a slow pass does not accumulate a queue. Applies only while `MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINERS` is enabled |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD_TOKENS` | BOT-RUNTIME-TUNING-B | unset (Hermes's own 256 000) | Absolute token cap for context compression, written to `compression.threshold_tokens` in every bot's `hermes/config.yaml`: Hermes compresses at the lower of the ratio threshold and this count, so on a large-window model a session no longer grows to half the window before compacting. The ticket's fleet default is `100000` — set it here, the compiler adds no default of its own | Read on every profile build; a change restarts bot containers (part of `config.yaml`). The supported range at compile time is 10 000–2 000 000; outside it the value is dropped with a profile warning, not an error. A non-integer value is likewise reported and dropped |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_MODEL_CONTEXT_LENGTH` | BOT-RUNTIME-TUNING-B | unset (no map) | Explicit context window per model alias: `alias=tokens,alias=tokens`, e.g. `model-a=131072`. When a card's model matches an alias, the value is written to `model.context_length` in that bot's `config.yaml`, overriding Hermes's per-model detected window. A card's own `models.contextLength` in its "Additional models" block wins over this map. Until the model registry exists, only this explicit map is consulted | Read on every profile build; a change restarts the affected bot containers. Entries without `=` or with a non-integer token count are skipped with a profile warning; the valid entries still apply. Compile-time range 8 000–10 000 000, out-of-range values are dropped with a warning |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_AUX_TITLE_MODEL` | BOT-RUNTIME-TUNING-B | unset | Gateway model alias written to `auxiliary.title_generation.model` for bots whose card sets no title model: the title generator then stops using the main (expensive) model and its LiteLLM fallback chain. The value must be a model alias the gateway actually knows — the operator names it; the setting has no default precisely because a hard-coded "free" model the gateway does not know would silently break title generation | Read on every profile build; a change restarts bot containers. The card's `models.titleGeneration` entry wins over this setting |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_AUX_COMPRESSION_MODEL` | BOT-RUNTIME-TUNING-B | unset | Same for `auxiliary.compression.model`: the model that summarizes a session during context compression. The operator names a gateway alias; no default for the same reason | Read on every profile build; a change restarts bot containers. The card's `models.compressionSummary` entry wins over this setting |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINER_GITHUB_ENV_ALLOWLIST` | FLEETD-VMEXEC | unset (empty) | Names of agents (comma-separated) whose cards may hold board-managed GitHub tokens (`env.GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` and relatives) as `secret_ref` for the container profile: the value is resolved with a check of the secret's binding to the agent and lands only in the container's `hermes/.env` (0600, secret), never in the container `Env` | Empty/unset — GitHub tokens from container cards are dropped with a warning, as before. The list is read at every resolution (once a minute per bot): emptying the setting restores default behavior on the next pass, without a restart. A fallback for development bots on a machine where the board's GitHub broker address is genuinely unreachable: since the run-bound broker capability reaches bot containers (CONTAINER-GITHUB-WRITE), most dev bots no longer need it — see the "Bot containers" section note below the table |
| `MYRMIDON_FLEET_HOST_URL` / `MYRMIDON_FLEET_HOST_TOKEN` | FLEETD-VMEXEC | unset | Address of the fleetd service (`http://host:port`, http only — internal network) and its token for the client driver `fleetd-driver.ts`; these are named wrappers over a host entry from the per-host map `MYRMIDON_FLEET_HOSTS` (see the next step of the branch), until the map is introduced the pair is read directly | Without both values the fleetd driver is not instantiated (configuration error), the local docker driver and default behavior are unchanged. The token is a value only in myrmidon-deploy, it is not in the repository or logs |
| `MYRMIDON_FLEET_HOSTS` | FLEETD-VMEXEC | unset (empty) | Map of named fleetd hosts for placing container bots: JSON array of entries `[{"name":"…","url":"http://…","tokenSecret":"…"}]` — host name (the bot card references it in `adapterConfig.container.host`), fleetd service address (only `http://`), name of the company secret with the fleetd token | Empty/unset — only the local driver, named hosts are impossible, a card with `container.host` gets an error. Invalid JSON, unknown key, duplicate name, non-http url or empty `tokenSecret` — an error, settings are not applied partially. Read at server startup |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_HINDSIGHT_API_URL` | W2a | unset (required when containers are enabled) | Address of the shared hindsight service as the bot container sees it; goes into `hermes/hindsight/config.json` (`api_url`). The memory mode is always `local_external`, a card cannot switch a bot to a cloud address | Without a value the profile is not assembled: the pass over a bot ends with an error in the activity log, the container is neither created nor changed. Address `http(s)://…`; the host's `localhost` from inside the container is not the same |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_HINDSIGHT_BANK` | W2a | unset | Default memory bank for a bot whose card has no `adapterConfig.hindsight.bankId` | No bank either in the card or here — the profile is not assembled (an error, not a "default" bank at hindsight) |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_HINDSIGHT_ALLOWED_BANKS` | W2a | unset (no check) | Comma-separated list of allowed banks; a bank in the card or from `MYRMIDON_BOT_HINDSIGHT_BANK` that is not in the list — a compilation error. Protection against a typo in `bankId` that would silently create a new bank | Empty or unset — no check (current behavior). Duplicates and empty list elements are ignored. The error names the bank and the setting. The card's `adapterConfig.hindsight.observationScopes` block is carried into the profile's `observation_scopes` (the same format as live hermes_local profiles: a list of tag lists) |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_LLM_BASE_URL` | W2a | unset; required for a card whose provider is not "own" | Address of the shared LLM gateway (OpenAI-compatible, e.g. LiteLLM) as the container sees it; goes into `model.base_url` and into every fallback model of the profile, but only of a card that talks through the gateway (provider empty, `auto`, `custom`, `custom:<name>`). A card with its own provider is not given the address: Hermes takes `model.base_url` for a named provider too, and the provider key would go to the gateway address | Needed by every card whose `provider` is empty, `auto`, `custom` or `custom:<name>`: without the address Hermes would go to the default OpenRouter address, so such a bot's profile is not assembled, and the error names this setting. A card with its own provider (`anthropic`, `gemini` and the like) does not need the setting: such a bot talks to its provider's address. Address `http(s)://…` |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_LLM_API_KEY_ENV` | W2a | unset; required for a card whose provider is not "own" | Name of the variable in `hermes/.env` in which the bot holds the LLM gateway key (name only, not the value). The value is taken from the card's env under this name, and if absent there — from the company secret (`MYRMIDON_BOT_LLM_API_KEY_SECRET`) | Needed by the same cards as `MYRMIDON_BOT_LLM_BASE_URL` (provider empty, `auto`, `custom`, `custom:<name>`): without the name Hermes would send the gateway the placeholder key `no-key-required`, so the profile is not assembled, and the error names this setting. A card with its own provider does not need it: the gateway key does not go into its profile. Set but the value exists nowhere — the profile is not assembled (an empty key is not written). The name cannot be `HOME`, `PATH`, `HERMES_HOME`, `API_SERVER_KEY`, `PAPERCLIP_API_URL`, `PAPERCLIP_API_KEY` |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_LLM_API_KEY_SECRET` | W2a | the value of `MYRMIDON_BOT_LLM_API_KEY_ENV` | Name of the company secret holding the LLM gateway key | The secret is created by the operator in the company's "Secrets" section; the system neither creates nor changes it. The secret value is read only for a card that talks through the gateway (a card with its own provider does not read it), and without an entry in the secret-usage log (the pass runs once a minute) |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_BOARD_URL` | W2a | unset (required when containers are enabled) | Address of the board as the bot container sees it, without `/api` (e.g. `http://board.example.com:3100`); goes into `PAPERCLIP_API_URL` in `hermes/.env` | Without a value the profile is not assembled. The system creates the bot's key on the board itself (`PAPERCLIP_API_KEY`): an agent key `myrmidon-bot-container` and a company secret `myrmidon-bot-<agentId>-paperclip-api-key` |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_MCP_SERVERS` | W2a | unset (no servers) | Shared MCP servers that every bot in a container gets (ragflow and the like): JSON array `[{"name":"ragflow","url":"http://ragflow.example.com/mcp","tokenSecret":"<company secret name>"}]`. The token is not stored in the setting: `tokenSecret` names a company secret, the value is read at every build and lands only in `hermes/.env` (in `config.yaml` — a `${VARIABLE_NAME}` reference). Optional: `header` (default `Authorization`), `scheme` (default `Bearer`; an empty string sends the token as-is), `noAuth: true` instead of `tokenSecret` for a server without a token. The server address, unlike the address of the board's tool gateway, is not rewritten by `MYRMIDON_HERMES_RUNTIME_MCP_URL_BASE` | Strict validation: invalid JSON, a repeated name, an entry without `tokenSecret` and without `noAuth`, a missing or empty secret — the bot's profile is not assembled, the error names the entry and the field, but not the value (the server on which the "ragflow via MCP" acceptance depends must not silently disappear). The name `paperclip-assigned` is reserved for the bot's board gateway: an entry with this name — the same error, the profile is not assembled (each bot's gateway is issued by the board, one shared token cannot replace it). Changing the value restarts bot containers (MCP is part of `config.yaml` and `.env`) |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_BOARD_GATEWAY` | W2a | `1` (enabled) | Each bot in a container gets its own board tool gateway: the `paperclip-assigned` server in the profile's `config.yaml` (same name as `hermes_local`), with the connections and tools assigned to this agent. The gateway belongs to the agent and is created separately for each set of assignments; the gateway token (30 days) is stored as company secret `myrmidon-bot-<agentId>-board-gateway-token`, goes into the profile only into `hermes/.env`, is rotated when less than 10 days remain; the previous token is revoked after a day. One bot's token does not open another bot's gateway and does not coincide with tokens from `MYRMIDON_BOT_MCP_SERVERS` | `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` — bot gateways are not issued, and already issued ones are disabled, tokens are revoked, the `paperclip-assigned` server leaves the profile (the bot restarts). A change is read at every profile build, no server restart needed. The gateway address is built from `MYRMIDON_BOT_BOARD_URL` (without `/api`) and rewritten by the same `MYRMIDON_HERMES_RUNTIME_MCP_URL_BASE` as for `hermes_local`. No assignments for the agent — no server, the gateway is not created. Likewise a gateway is not issued to an agent with status `terminated` or `pending_approval` (issued ones are disabled, tokens revoked), and gateways of agents the reconciliation does not collect (deleted, terminated, adapter changed, container disabled) each pass releases itself; with `MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINERS` off there is no pass. One bot's gateway can be disabled manually (status `disabled` on the gateway itself): reconciliation does not re-enable it, there is no delivery, a warning in the log; it re-enables only a gateway it disabled itself. The server name `paperclip-assigned` cannot be declared in `MYRMIDON_BOT_MCP_SERVERS`. Calls through this gateway are bound to the agent's single active run (A2): the audit shows run_id, responsible, task and project, and the task/project tools (`create_project`, `list_projects`, `list_project_repositories`, `create_task`) go through the same gateway by the same path as with `hermes_local`; zero or more than one active run — no binding, agent tools work, task/project tools are rejected |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CANARY` | R5-B | off | Enables the canary rollout of the bot image: the `/api/myrmidon/bot-canary` routes, the job tick and resumption of an open job at server startup. The rollout itself does not touch containers until the operator creates a job | `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` — enable. Off — read routes work, writes answer 503, the tick does not start, nothing is read at server startup. Container reconciliation (`MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINERS`) must be enabled alongside it |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CANARY_SELECTOR` | R5-B | unset | botKey of the canary agent (agentId): the new image is applied to this one bot first, with the health check and the smoke run, before any waves | Unset — a job cannot be created (503 with a hint): the canary is chosen explicitly, not guessed. The canary must be a container bot that reconciliation collects (otherwise the job cancels with a reason). Read at job creation |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CANARY_WAVE_SIZE` | R5-B | `4` | How many bots are in one wave after the canary succeeds (one bot at a time inside a wave, each through its own agent maintenance window) | From 1 to 32; the default of 4 is the same limit as the reconciliation concurrency (`RECONCILE_CONCURRENCY`), so a wave does not take more memory than a regular pass |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CANARY_STEP_TIMEOUT_SEC` | R5-B | `1800` | How many seconds a job may stand in one status before it cancels itself | From 60 to 86400 |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CANARY_HEALTH_SETTLE_SEC` | R5-B | `90` | How many seconds the canary container must stay healthy (Docker HEALTHCHECK) before the smoke run | From 0 to 3600; 0 — no settle wait, starts at once |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CANARY_SMOKE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | R5-B | `300` | Budget of the smoke run: one `POST /v1/runs` to the canary gateway, polled to a terminal status | From 10 to 3600. A run that does not finish in time — canary failure (`canary_smoke_failed`) |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CANARY_TICK_SEC` | R5-B | `5` | How often the tick reconciles the open job with the facts (container status, smoke, waves) | From 1 to 3600 |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CANARY_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_SEC` | R5-B | `30` | Timeout of network digest checks (registry, GitHub) at job creation and preview | From 1 to 300 |
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_CANARY_AUTO_ROLLBACK` | R5-C | `1` (on) | Health-based automatic rollback of the bot fleet: a canary failure (health or smoke) or a wave-bot failure moves the rollout to `rolling_back` — every bot that received the new image (the canary once its switch started, plus the applied wave bots) gets its own card image re-applied through the same `applyBotContainerNow`, one bot at a time; the rollout then ends `rolled_back` with the original failure reason kept. An apply error during the rollback ends the rollout loudly (`aborted` with the reason): the sweep re-applies the card image on its next pass anyway | `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` — the older R5-B behavior: the failure ends the rollout with a terminal status (`canary_failed`/`canary_smoke_failed`/`failed_health`), the canary stays on the new image for inspection, the rollback is manual |
With `MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINERS` enabled, W2a assembles the profile from the `hermes_gateway` card, and after a successful pass over a bot writes into the card `adapterConfig.apiBaseUrl` (`http://myrmidon-bot-<botKey>:8642`), `adapterConfig.apiKey` (a reference to the company secret `myrmidon-bot-<agentId>-api-server-key`, the bot's gateway key, created at the first build) and `adapterConfig.dangerouslyAllowInsecureRemoteHttp: true`. The third field is needed because the Hermes gateway adapter refuses to send the key over plain http to a remote address, and the container address is exactly that (`http://myrmidon-bot-<botKey>:8642`, not loopback). Traffic does not leave the bots' docker network (`MYRMIDON_BOT_NETWORK`): this is the board's path to its own container, so encryption on it is not needed; the field applies only to this card. A narrower variant (the adapter itself trusts `myrmidon-bot-*` hostnames) requires an adapter change and is not part of this PR, see DIVERGENCE. These three fields in container mode belong to the system: whatever is entered into them by hand will be replaced. The MCP gateway address for the profile is rewritten by the same `MYRMIDON_HERMES_RUNTIME_MCP_URL_BASE` and the same card fields (`runtimeMcpUrlBase`, `runtimeMcpUrlRewrite`) as for `hermes_local` (P4). The `adapterConfig.hindsight` block (`bankId`, `tags`, `mission`, `recallBudget`, `memoryMode`, `autoRetain`) is optional. The bot's instructions reach the model once, and only in the `/v1/runs` request: the adapter (G4) sends the agent instruction-pack entry file, then `adapterConfig.instructions` (or `payloadTemplate.instructions`, or the adapter's standard string) after a `---` separator, exactly as for a card outside a container. The profile does not write `workspace/AGENTS.md`: Hermes checks `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules` and `.hermes.md` with the injection scanner and on a match (e.g. the text has a `curl` command with `$PAPERCLIP_API_KEY`) replaces the whole file with a stub, while the request `instructions` field it does not scan. The remaining text files of the pack (`HEARTBEAT.md`, `SOUL.md`, the `docs/` folder) are placed into `workspace/` under the same relative paths, because the entry file references them; a file under a name that Hermes loads as project context (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.hermes.md`, in any directory and any case) is skipped with a log entry. Pack limits: at most 50 files, a file at most 256 KiB, a path no longer than 200 characters; a binary, oversized or extra file is skipped with a log entry, not truncated. Editing any pack file rewrites the files in the container without a restart. The card's `env` variables are read the same way as when running the card on the board: names reserved by the board (`PAPERCLIP_API_KEY`, the GitHub bridge and runner network-access variables) and GitHub tokens (`GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `PAPERCLIP_GIT_TOKEN`: the run drops them under board-managed GitHub credentials, and the bot container has no "host credentials" mode) are dropped with a warning; a secret must be bound to this agent at `env.<NAME>` (otherwise the profile is not assembled); the value is read once and held in memory, re-read only when bindings or the secret's version/status change, so that the once-a-minute pass does not write to the secret-access log. The board tool gateway enters the bot's profile as MCP server `paperclip-assigned`: each bot has its own gateway and its own token (see `MYRMIDON_BOT_BOARD_GATEWAY`); agent connections that need the run's identity (a user's personal OAuth) do not enter the container, and a warning about this is written to the container activity log (once per change). Shared servers from `MYRMIDON_BOT_MCP_SERVERS` work independently of the gateway. The bot's key on the board (`myrmidon-bot-container`) is created and stored atomically: the token in the secret must belong to the active key; if the secret write failed, the just-created key is revoked; surplus active keys with the same name are revoked after success. The key is issued to the responsible user: the board rejects an agent key without one (403 `RESPONSIBLE_USER_UNAVAILABLE` on every call). The user is taken by the same rule as a board job without an active person (routines): the company's default user (`defaultResponsibleUserId`), otherwise its oldest active owner; neither — the key is not issued and the profile build fails with an error, the container is not created. A key without a user issued by a previous driver version is fixed in place on the nearest pass: the empty field is filled by the same rule with one conditional UPDATE (only the active `myrmidon-bot-container` key and only while the field is empty), token and secret are unchanged, the container is not restarted; an already filled field (e.g. by hand) is not touched. If there is no user to take or the update failed, a warning is written to the container activity log and the pass repeats on the next tick.

**Managed GitHub credentials reach the container per run (CONTAINER-GITHUB-WRITE).**
When a run's GitHub identity is board-managed (the default; see
`MYRMIDON_HOST_GITHUB_CREDENTIALS` above), the heartbeat mints a run-bound
`github_credentials` capability and the gateway adapter carries it inside the
`/v1/runs` request body (`github_broker`). The gateway binds it to that run
alone — contextvars, never the process env shared by concurrent runs — and
bridges the pair into every terminal and `execute_code` subprocess of the run
as `PAPERCLIP_GITHUB_BROKER_URL`/`PAPERCLIP_GITHUB_BROKER_TOKEN`. While a
capability is bound, the bridge also blanks inherited `GH_TOKEN`/
`GITHUB_TOKEN` (and the related token names) in those subprocesses, so a
static token from the image profile cannot shadow the broker credential. The
dev image's `git` credential helper (URL-scoped to `github.com` over https;
`ssh://git@github.com/…` remotes are rewritten to https) and its `gh` wrapper
resolve the credential per invocation through the board's broker
(`POST /runtime-tools/github/credentials`) and exec the real `git`/`gh`,
walking up to 6 broker address candidates
(`PAPERCLIP_GITHUB_BROKER_URL` → `PAPERCLIP_API_URL` →
`PAPERCLIP_RUNTIME_API_URL` → `PAPERCLIP_RUNTIME_API_CANDIDATES_JSON` items)
and never printing the token. A run without a capability gets both env names
stripped; the wrappers then fail open (the real `git`/`gh` runs with the
environment unchanged). The broker URL the board sends is its own
`PAPERCLIP_API_URL`, so the container must be able to reach that address —
that reachability, not a delivery gap, is what `MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINER_GITHUB_ENV_ALLOWLIST`
above remains for.

The "Container" section of the agent card (W2b) introduces no new variables. It reads
`MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINERS` and `MYRMIDON_BOT_IMAGE_ALLOWLIST` through
`GET /api/myrmidon/agents/:id/bot-container/status` (a hint "which images are allowed",
a verdict on the saved image) and through `POST .../apply` ("Apply now"). A disabled
`MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINERS` gives status "off" and a 409 refusal on "apply". Until the instance
has connected the reconciler runtime (driver and G2 profile compiler), `apply` answers 503, and status
does not ask the container. The runtime is connected by server startup (`startBotContainers`, W2a) with
`MYRMIDON_BOT_CONTAINERS` enabled: the same runtime as the periodic pass. The card field limits (memory 128–262144 MB, CPU 0.1–128, processes
16–65536) are UI rules against typos; the server requires only positive numbers.

## 1.3 — WORKSPACE-HYGIENE (agent workspaces)

## 1.4 — live browser screen (BROWSER-CONSOLE)

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_BROWSER_FLEET` | BROWSER-CONSOLE | unset (fleet empty) | The live browser registry: a JSON array `[{"id":"browser-a","displayName":"Live browser A","egress":{"ru":"socks ru1","ig":"socks nd1"}}]`. The list, screen, journal and site-data cleanup in the Settings → Browsers section read this registry; "who is using it" comes from live sessions. Identifiers are lowercase slugs, up to 16 browsers, up to 8 egress keys. Read on every request, no restart needed | Invalid JSON, not an array, a bad id or a duplicate identifier — the registry is read as empty, a warning goes to the server log; the section answers with an empty list, not an error |
| `MYRMIDON_BROWSER_CONSOLE_HOST` | BROWSER-CONSOLE | unset | Base address of the screen node HTTP API (x11vnc+websockify, a separate deployment). Read in `server/src/myrmidon/browser-console/screen-console-client.ts` | Unset or empty — calls to the node are impossible: "Open screen" answers 502 (the node "did not answer"). The value is not logged |
| `MYRMIDON_BROWSER_CONSOLE_TOKEN` | BROWSER-CONSOLE | unset | The screen node token, sent as Bearer. Read in the same place | Unset — same as without the host. The value is not logged |
| `MYRMIDON_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MIN` | BROWSER-CONSOLE | `30` | After how many minutes without activity (POST `/screen/heartbeat` with `activity: true`) the screen session closes on its own: bots resume, the journal gets `closedBy: idle_timeout` | From 1 to 1440; unset, non-numeric or out of range — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_BROWSER_MAX_DURATION_MIN` | BROWSER-CONSOLE | `120` | A hard session ceiling: closes even with constant activity (`closedBy: max_duration`) | From 5 to 1440; unset, non-numeric or out of range — the default |

The screen session, "who is using it" and the journal (the last 50 entries: who/when/duration/closed-by)
are stored in `instance_settings.general.myrmidonBrowserConsole` — no migrations. The owner (role owner
in the company, instance admin, local implicit) opens the screen, closes it ("Done"), cleans site data
and reads the journal; any authenticated panel user reads the registry; agents get 403 for everything
except the registry. While a session is open, the screen node receives `pause` for bots (the contract) and
the board server rejects MCP calls into that browser (423, a safeguard). Site-data cleanup takes a
domain typed in (bare domain); cookies+storage are cleaned on the node via CDP.

## 1.3 — WORKSPACE-HYGIENE (agent workspaces)

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_WORKSPACE_QUOTA_MB` | WH-C | unset (disabled) | Disk ceiling per workspace: a pass from the scheduler tick measures each workspace's directory (a walk bounded by depth, entries and time; sums over hardlink inodes are not duplicated) and on excess writes a "clean up" signal to the activity log — at most once a day per workspace. The variable is the default at first start: afterwards the effective values are stored in settings (`instance_settings.general.workspaceHygiene`) and change on the fly via `GET`/`PATCH /api/myrmidon/workspace-hygiene` (read — board, write — instance-admin). The pass deletes nothing — deletion remains with terminal-workspace resolution | Unset, empty, `0`, negative or non-numeric — the ceiling is off (no signals). Only workspaces with a local directory (`providerType = local_fs`) are measured; a workspace whose walk hit the bound is counted by the lower bound, and its report has `truncated` |
| `MYRMIDON_WORKSPACE_TOTAL_QUOTA_MB` | WH-C | unset (disabled) | Ceiling on the sum of measured workspaces of one company: a separate signal in the activity log, at most once a day per company. Catches the case "many workspaces, each within its own ceiling" | Unset, empty, `0`, negative or non-numeric — the ceiling is off |

## 1.3 — STACK-UPDATES stack registry (SUA, parts A and B)

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_STACK_DOCKER_SOCKET` | SUA | `/var/run/docker.sock` | Path to the Docker unix socket the stack registry image probes use to read digests and component labels with the `docker-image` probe (Docker API `GET /images/{ref}/json`, 10s timeout) | Socket unavailable on `POST /api/myrmidon/stack/refresh` — 503, the previous cache is kept; an individual missing image is an honest «unknown» with a reason, not an error. Read on every refresh, no server restart needed |
| `MYRMIDON_STACK_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC` | SUB | unset (off) | How often (sec) the scheduled stack release check runs: for `github-releases`/`github-tags` components it reads the anonymous release/tag list, records the latest, our lag and the notable release-note lines (security/breaking/CVE, top-5) into the stack cache, and evaluates the "is our carried patch closed upstream" rule through the compare API. `POST /api/myrmidon/stack/check` (instance-admin) runs the same code on demand | Unset, empty, `0`, negative or non-numeric — the sweep is off and the board touches the network only through the manual route. Values below 60 are lifted to 60. A transport failure answers 503 and keeps the previous cache; an HTTP error status is recorded per component |

## EXTCASE-B — мост браузера расширению клиента

Настройки серверного модуля `server/src/myrmidon/browser-bridge/` (первый сторонний кейс: браузерные
действия выполняются в браузере клиента, доска туда не дотягивается). Настройки моста задаются не
переменной окружения, а записью `instance_settings.general.browserBridge`
(`GET`/`PATCH /api/myrmidon/browser-bridge/settings`, чтение — board, запись — instance-admin):
`domains` — домены ТП (allowlist), `signing` — политика подписи клиента
(`enabled` — аварийное выключение, `mode` — `auto`/`manual`/`types`, `types` — типы действий,
которые требуют человека при `mode: types`). Аварийное выключение одной кнопкой —
`POST /api/myrmidon/browser-bridge/signing/disable`; после него шлюз отклоняет любое sign-действие
(fail-closed), а факт выключения пишется в журнал компании.

| Переменная | Функция | По умолчанию | Что делает | Как выключить / особое |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_BROWSER_BRIDGE_PEPPER` | EXTCASE-B | не задана | Перец HMAC для pairing-кодов и bridge-токенов моста: в базе лежат только дайджесты, по ним проверяются предъявленный код (обмен на токен устройства) и токен при подключении расширения к `/bridge/v1` | Не задана — процесс берёт случайный перец на свой старт и пишет предупреждение: всё выданное до перезапуска перестаёт проверяться, устройства парируются заново (панель выдаёт новый код). Задаётся в окружении доски, значение — секрет, в репозитории и логах не хранится. Перец общий на инстанс, поэтому он не лежит в настройках, которые панель читает и правит |

## 1.4 — EXT-CASE-OCR (the OCR path: PDF -> text in the bot workspace)

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_OCR_BASE_URL` | EXT-CASE-OCR | unset (path closed) | Address of the company's OCR contour as the board sees it: the MCP address of RAGFlow or an OpenAI-compatible gateway address (LiteLLM). Together with `MYRMIDON_OCR_KEY_SECRET` it opens the path; without either of the two settings the bot gets a stable `ocr_disabled` refusal and not a single request goes out | Empty/unset — the path is closed. The address may end with `/v1` (then it is not duplicated) |
| `MYRMIDON_OCR_KEY_SECRET` | EXT-CASE-OCR | unset | **Name** of the company secret holding the OCR contour key (not the value). The value is read on every call for the task's owning company; it never appears in the setting, logs or journal | Empty/unset — the path is closed. The secret is created by the company's operator in the "Secrets" section |
| `MYRMIDON_OCR_BACKEND` | EXT-CASE-OCR | `ragflow` | Which adapter is called: `ragflow` (MCP JSON-RPC `tools/call`, DeepDOC parsing) or `litellm` (chat request with the PDF as a file part). An unknown value — `ragflow` (a typo must not close the path) | With `litellm` and no `MYRMIDON_OCR_MODEL` the profile is not assembled: the call answers `ocr_disabled` |
| `MYRMIDON_OCR_MODEL` | EXT-CASE-OCR | unset | For `litellm` — the name of the model that reads the PDF; for `ragflow` — the name of the parsing MCP tool (RAGFlow versions name it differently), `parse_document` by default | Empty — `litellm` refuses `ocr_disabled`, `ragflow` takes `parse_document` |
| `MYRMIDON_OCR_MAX_BYTES` | EXT-CASE-OCR | `33554432` (32 MiB) | PDF size ceiling: above it — a `document_too_large` refusal before the backend is contacted (and before base64 is decoded in the tool) | Non-numeric, `0`, negative — the default is taken |
| `MYRMIDON_OCR_MAX_PAGES` | EXT-CASE-OCR | `500` | Page-count ceiling (the page count is read from the PDF bytes); above it — a `too_many_pages` refusal before the backend | As above |
| `MYRMIDON_OCR_MAX_CHARS` | EXT-CASE-OCR | `2000000` | Ceiling on the recognized text: the remainder is cut, the metadata gets `truncated: true` | As above |
| `MYRMIDON_OCR_TIMEOUT_SEC` | EXT-CASE-OCR | `120` | Timeout of the request to the OCR backend (from 5 to 600; below 5 is raised to 5) | As above |
| `MYRMIDON_OCR_WORKSPACE_DIR` | EXT-CASE-OCR | unset | Directory where a copy of the recognized text is placed (`<name>-<hash>.txt`, mode 0600). Without the setting the text lives only in the tool's response (a container bot writes it into its workspace itself) | Empty — no copy on disk |

The bot's tool is `ocr.pdf` (input: `name`, `base64`, optional `origin`, `sourceId`; output: `text`,
`pages`, `structure`, `metadata`). Served to the company at `POST /api/myrmidon/companies/:companyId/ocr/mcp`
(JSON-RPC: `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`); only metadata goes to the activity journal
(`name`, `sizeBytes`, `pages`, `origin`, `sourceId`, `backend`, `chars`, `truncated`) — the text and bytes
never enter the journal.

## 1.6 — EVALS-A (reference tasks and the LLM judge)

Settings of the module `server/src/myrmidon/evals/` (the 1.6 evals path: a seeded corpus of neutral
reference tasks for the pilot role, an LLM judge behind the company's LLM gateway, scores stored in
`myrmidon_eval_runs`, a threshold+repeat regression verdict). Reads are company-scoped; run mutations
need a board actor. While the contour below is not configured, reads still work and mutations answer
`503` with the names of the missing settings instead of guessing.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_EVALS_BASE_URL` | EVALS-A | unset (judge disabled) | Address of the company's LLM gateway contour (OpenAI-compatible, e.g. LiteLLM). Together with `MYRMIDON_EVALS_KEY_SECRET` it opens the judge path; without either the evals mutations answer `503` with the reason | Empty/unset — the judge is disabled (reads still work). The address may end with `/v1` (then it is not duplicated) |
| `MYRMIDON_EVALS_KEY_SECRET` | EVALS-A | unset | **Name** of the company secret holding the gateway key (not the value). The value is read per company on every run; it never appears in the setting, logs or journal | Empty/unset — the judge is disabled |
| `MYRMIDON_EVALS_MODEL` | EVALS-A | `qwen-plus-free` | The judge model behind the gateway. The 1.6 wave rule applies: a free DashScope model by default; paid models stay a deploy-repo concern | Any value the gateway serves |
| `MYRMIDON_EVALS_TIMEOUT_SEC` | EVALS-A | `120` | Timeout of one judge chat-completions call (valid range 5 to 600) | Non-numeric, `0`, negative — the default is taken |
| `MYRMIDON_EVALS_LANGFUSE` | EVALS-A | unset | Master flag for the Langfuse score export: `true` enables exporting run scores to Langfuse when the contour below is configured. Scoring is written locally (eval_runs) regardless of this flag | Empty/unset/anything but `true` — no Langfuse export, local scoring only |
| `MYRMIDON_EVALS_LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` | EVALS-A | unset | Langfuse ingestion base URL (the `/api/public/ingestion` suffix is appended). Used only when `MYRMIDON_EVALS_LANGFUSE=true` | Empty — the export is a no-op |
| `MYRMIDON_EVALS_LANGFUSE_KEY` | EVALS-A | unset | Langfuse public ingestion key. Used only when `MYRMIDON_EVALS_LANGFUSE=true` | Empty — the export is a no-op |
| `MYRMIDON_EVALS_LANGFUSE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | EVALS-A | `30` | Timeout of the Langfuse ingestion request (from 1 to 600) | Non-numeric, `0`, negative — the default is taken |

The board API is `GET/POST /api/myrmidon/companies/:companyId/evals/{tasks,seed,runs,runs/:runId,runs/:runId/confirm,verdict}`.
The judge never executes code: for `code`-kind reference tasks the CI pass rate arrives as a request
parameter and is folded into the aggregate as a separate score line.

The operator guide for the whole path — seeding the corpus, running a subject,
the promote/confirm/regress verdict with its threshold+repeat rule, the
journal rows and the Langfuse export — is
[guides/reference-task-evals.md](guides/reference-task-evals.md).

## EXTCASE-B — browser bridge to the client's extension

Settings of the server module `server/src/myrmidon/browser-bridge/` (the first third-party case: browser
actions run in the client's browser, the board cannot reach it). The bridge is configured not by an
environment variable but by the `instance_settings.general.browserBridge` record
(`GET`/`PATCH /api/myrmidon/browser-bridge/settings`, read — board, write — instance-admin):
`domains` — the allowlist of support domains, `signing` — the client signing policy
(`enabled` — emergency off, `mode` — `auto`/`manual`/`types`, `types` — action types that require
a human under `mode: types`). The one-button emergency off is
`POST /api/myrmidon/browser-bridge/signing/disable`; after it the gateway rejects any sign action
(fail-closed) and the fact is written to the company journal.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_BROWSER_BRIDGE_PEPPER` | EXTCASE-B | unset | HMAC pepper for pairing codes and bridge tokens of the bridge: only digests live in the database; the presented code (exchanged for a device token) and the token at the extension's `/bridge/v1` connection are verified against them | Unset — the process takes a random pepper at its startup and logs a warning: everything issued before the restart stops validating, devices re-pair (the panel issues a new code). Set in the board's environment; the value is a secret, never stored in the repo or logs. The pepper is per-instance, which is why it is not kept in the settings the panel reads and edits |

## Settings in the agent record (not environment variables)

| Field | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `permissions.toolAccess` | S6 | `{ "mode": "all" }`, written into the agent record explicitly | The agent's permission for tools and connections. `mode: "listed"` — only tools from `tools` and connections from `connections` are allowed, other calls are rejected (403, `deny_agent_permission`, a line in the call log). Set by the operator in the agent card (Permissions tab, "Tool and connection access" section) or `PATCH /api/agents/:id/permissions` with the `toolAccess` field | `{ "mode": "all" }` — previous behavior. An agent without the field and a record with an unreadable value are read as `all` |

## SC1 — server console (SERVER-CONSOLE, 1.4)

The "Server console" section in company settings (`server/src/myrmidon/fleet-console/`,
contract — [design/server-console.md](design/server-console.md)). One variable: the address
of the Guacamole client. The signing key and node passwords are company secrets, not
environment variables.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_FLEET_CONSOLE_URL` | SC1 | unset (off) | Base address of the Guacamole client for which the panel signs the auth-JSON (e.g. `https://guac.example.com`, no trailing `/`). It also goes into the token-issuing response and the `consoleUrl` address | Unset or empty — token issuance answers `503 console_not_configured`, the node registry and the log keep working. The company secret with the shared key is `guacamole-json-secret-key` (the value is read by the server, never appears in a response or the log); a registry row may reference a secret with the node password. Read at route assembly on server startup |

## CLOUD-CONNECTOR — cloud storage connector (1.4)

The "Clouds" module (`server/src/myrmidon/cloud-connector/`, contract —
`packages/shared/src/myrmidon-cloud-connector.ts`). The connector state lives in
`instance_settings.general.myrmidonCloudConnector`; the owner's token never does — it is a company
secret of the instance secret store (`myrmidon-cloud-<provider>`), written by the connect flow and
rotated on every automatic refresh. A provider with no client credentials here cannot be connected;
a folder whose company has no connected account answers a cloud call with `409 not connected`.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_CLOUD_CONNECTOR_REDIRECT_BASE` | CLOUD-CONNECTOR | unset (off) | Public base address of the panel the cloud providers send the owner back to (e.g. `https://board.example.com`, no trailing `/`). The connectors' callback is `<base>/api/myrmidon/cloud-connector/oauth/callback` and must be registered in each provider's OAuth app | Unset or empty — the callback address stays relative and every connect start answers `409 the connector callback address is not configured`; the folder/grant/journal surface keeps working |
| `MYRMIDON_CLOUD_ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_ID` | CLOUD-CONNECTOR | unset (off) | OAuth client id of the Microsoft (OneDrive) app. Scopes requested: `Files.ReadWrite.All offline_access User.Read`; the account is a personal Microsoft account (`consumers`) | Unset — OneDrive cannot be connected (`409 not configured`); everything else keeps working |
| `MYRMIDON_CLOUD_ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET` | CLOUD-CONNECTOR | unset | Client secret of the same app. Read by the server only, never returned in a response or written to a log | — |
| `MYRMIDON_CLOUD_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID` | CLOUD-CONNECTOR | unset (off) | OAuth client id of the Google Drive app. Scope requested: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` with `access_type=offline` (the connector confines every call to the granted folder) | Unset — Google Drive cannot be connected; the provider itself is registered by default |
| `MYRMIDON_CLOUD_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET` | CLOUD-CONNECTOR | unset | Client secret of the same app | — |
| `MYRMIDON_CLOUD_YANDEX_DISK_CLIENT_ID` | CLOUD-CONNECTOR | unset (off) | OAuth client id of the Yandex Disk app. Scopes requested: `cloud_api:disk.read cloud_api:disk.write`; Yandex does not support PKCE, so none is sent | Unset — Yandex Disk cannot be connected; the provider itself is registered by default |
| `MYRMIDON_CLOUD_YANDEX_DISK_CLIENT_SECRET` | CLOUD-CONNECTOR | unset | Client secret of the same app | — |

Agent surface: the connector also serves the cloud tools over MCP at
`POST <board>/api/mcp/cloud-tools` (JSON-RPC; `initialize`, `tools/list`,
`tools/call` with `cloud_list`, `cloud_search`, `cloud_read`, `cloud_download`,
`cloud_upload`, `cloud_move`). It needs no variable of its own: the caller is the
agent's own run key, and every call is confined to the folders granted to that
agent. To let agents see the tools, register the board address as a tool
connection and assign it — the endpoint itself is always on.

Two things the agent surface relies on that are worth knowing when a call is
refused. A `caste` grant matches the agent's board role (`agents.role`), read
per call; an agent whose role is empty has no caste and only matches grants to
the agent itself or to everyone. And the root name `personal` is reserved: it
always means the calling agent's own folder, which the connector creates on
first use and grants `rw` to that agent alone. The owner cannot create a folder
with that name (`400 reserved`), and an agent asking for it is told what to do
when the answer is not obvious — no account connected for its company, or
several clouds connected (`409`, naming the providers).

## 1.4 — agent memory card (MEMORY-UI)

The "Memory" tab of the agent card (`server/src/myrmidon/agent-memory/`):
view, export and remove the entries of the agent's memory bank (the same
service the memory plugin writes to). Two variables, both required to enable;
the key itself is a company secret, not an environment variable.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_HINDSIGHT_API_URL` | MEMORY-UI | unset (off) | Base address of the shared memory (hindsight) service as the board server sees it; the tab's list, export, delete and clear calls go there | Unset, empty or not an `http(s)://` URL — the section is off: status answers `enabled: false`, data routes answer 503. Read per request, no restart needed. The address is not logged |
| `MYRMIDON_HINDSIGHT_KEY_SECRET` | MEMORY-UI | unset (off) | Name of the company secret holding the memory service API key (self-hosted deployments with no auth may name a missing secret — the calls then go without a token) | Unset or empty — off, same as above. The key value is read only for the duration of a call, never written to the log or an API response |

## 1.4 — agent instructions revisions (H2)

The revision history of an agent's instructions bundle
(`server/src/myrmidon/agent-instructions-revisions/`): every bundle edit is
snapshotted into the `agent_instructions_revisions` table and any earlier
revision can be restored from the agent card. No new variables: the feature is
always on and needs no configuration. Recorded here per the registry rule.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | H2 | — (always on) | Instructions bundle revisions are recorded on every file put/delete and bundle patch, and `POST /api/agents/:id/instructions-revisions/:revisionId/rollback` restores a revision (the restore itself becomes a new revision). No settings | Not configurable: this is a corrective feature with no deployment-specific values. Rollback of an external bundle is refused (422) until the agent switches to a managed bundle |

## 1.4 — automatic resume from `error` (AUTO-RESUME)

An agent left in `error` by a failed run is resumed by the board itself with a
backoff of 1, 5 and 15 minutes, reusing the L3 pause/resume wake chain (the
resumed agent also wakes the work it was stranded on). After the attempt cap the
board stops and escalates the agent's `agent_error_alert` card on the attention
desk to "the board gave up; an operator must intervene". The failure counter and
the give-up mark live in `agents.metadata.myrmidon_auto_resume`; an agent record
change after the give-up (an operator action) re-arms the counter.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_AUTO_RESUME_ENABLED` | AUTO-RESUME | `1` (on) | Master switch: the board resumes an agent left in `error` on its own | `0`/`false`/`off`/`no` — disable (vendor behaviour: `error` until an operator resumes by hand). Unset or unrecognized — enabled |
| `MYRMIDON_AUTO_RESUME_BACKOFF_MS` | AUTO-RESUME | `60000,300000,900000` (1/5/15 min) | Comma-separated backoff steps in milliseconds per resume attempt; the last step repeats. The first attempt is due one step after the agent entered `error` | Only positive integers are read; invalid entries are dropped; an empty or all-invalid list falls back to the default |
| `MYRMIDON_AUTO_RESUME_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | AUTO-RESUME | `3` | Failed resumes in one streak before the board gives up and raises the operator card; the agent is then left in `error` until an operator acts | Non-numeric, `0`, negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_AUTO_RESUME_INTERVAL_SEC` | AUTO-RESUME | `60` | How often (sec) the sweep looks for due agents; the sweep runs on the scheduler tick and this gate keeps it per-minute | Values below 10 — 10. Non-numeric, `0`, negative — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_AUTO_RESUME_WINDOW_MS` | AUTO-RESUME | `3600000` (1 h) | A streak whose last failure is older than this is treated as a new episode (the attempt counter restarts) | Non-numeric, `0`, negative — the default |

## 1.5 — TRACING-HEALTH: LLM tracing health check

Settings of `server/src/myrmidon/tracing-health/` — `GET /api/myrmidon/tracing/health`.
The check shares the gateway address and key with the M2-A cost collection
(`MYRMIDON_LITELLM_BASE_URL` + `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_KEY_SECRET`, see the Bot
containers section above); only the Langfuse ClickHouse endpoints are new rows.
All off by default.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_CLICKHOUSE_URL` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset (off) | Address of the Langfuse ClickHouse HTTP interface (`http(s)://…:8123`) over which the health check counts the trace events of the window in `events_core` (Langfuse v4 `events_only` mode: the `traces`/`observations` tables stay empty, the data lives in ClickHouse — counting them is wrong by design). The address is not stored in the open repository; the value is set by the deployment | Set together with the two `MYRMIDON_LITELLM_*` gateway settings; without all three the check is off and `GET /api/myrmidon/tracing/health` answers 503 `{enabled: false}` |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_CLICKHOUSE_USER` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | ClickHouse user for the health check queries | Unset — the query goes without user/password parameters |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` | TRACING-HEALTH | unset | ClickHouse password of that user | Sent as a request parameter of the ClickHouse HTTP interface and never logged, stored or returned in the response |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE` | TRACING-HEALTH | `default` | Database of the Langfuse tables (`events_core`, `langfuse_ingestion_rejections`) | — |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_WINDOW_SEC` | TRACING-HEALTH | `900` (15 min) | Length of the health check window: events in ClickHouse and gateway requests are counted over the last N seconds | From 60 to 3600; non-integer or out of bounds — the default. A window with no gateway traffic is the state `idle` (OK with a reason), not an alarm: the check must not cry wolf on quiet periods |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_HEALTH_TTL_SEC` | TRACING-HEALTH | `60` | Cache TTL of the report: the probes run at most once per TTL; inside it the previous report is served (checkedAt shows when it was actually measured) | From 5 to 3600; non-integer or out of bounds — the default. Any probe failure is the state `unknown` with a reason in the JSON contract, never a 500 |
| `MYRMIDON_TRACING_SIGNAL_INTERVAL_SEC` | TRACING-HEALTH | `300` | Period (sec) of the operator-signal sweep (part D): the board itself polls the tracing health report and records the attention signal + the state-transition journal row, so the operator desk is fresh even when nobody has the status card open. A steady state writes nothing — one row per transition only | From 60 to 86400; non-integer or out of bounds — the default. Off together with the check itself: no tracing settings — no timer, no query |

Health semantics (the operator's 02.10 findings, baked into the domain):
`idle` without gateway traffic; `degraded` when events are missing while traffic
flowed, when the delivery ratio (OTEL events in `events_core` per gateway
request) is below 0.5, when any "Rejected … legacy" ingestion rejection landed
in the window (the incident signature), or when the callback error rate is at
or above 0.02; `unknown` on probe failure. The evidence fields `deliveryRatio`
and `legacyRejections` are additive parts of the JSON contract for the part D
dedup key; fields without a source stay null and never block the computation.

The check has two board surfaces, both reading the same report — see
[guides/tracing-health.md](guides/tracing-health.md): the "LLM tracing" status
card in Company settings and the operator attention signal that runs even when
nobody has the card open.


## 1.6 — WIKI-CORTEX: company regulations in the wiki

Regulation pages of `server/src/myrmidon/wiki-cortex/` — draft → approved
lifecycle, revisions, rollback, the role resolver, and the delivery of
`REGULATIONS.md` into the compiled bot profile. See
`docs/myrmidon/guides/wiki-regulations.md` for the API and the wiki-maintainer
runbook. No new variables: the feature is always on and needs no configuration.
Recorded here per the registry rule.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | WIKI-CORTEX | — (always on) | `PUT /api/myrmidon/companies/:id/wiki-regulations/:slug` saves a draft revision; `POST …/approve` (board only) makes the newest revision the delivered text; `POST …/rollback` (board only) restores an earlier revision as a new one; `GET …/approved/:role` is the resolver the bot profile compile reads and renders into the agent's workspace `REGULATIONS.md` | Not configurable: no deployment-specific values. The delivered file never shadows a `REGULATIONS.md` the agent's own bundle ships (a warning is recorded instead) |

## TASK-PR-SYNC — a task settles once its pull requests merge

A task whose `work_product` of type `pull_request` merged used to stay busy
until someone noticed. The scheduler tick now runs a pass that refreshes each
PR's state through the existing GitHub resolver and closes the task (`done`,
one comment with the PR refs / merge sha / time, an activity row) when every
PR has reached a terminal state and at least one merged and no post-deploy
gate is still open. When none of them merged, the task goes back to its
assignee (`in_progress` plus a comment) unless a newer comment already
answered the closure. The sweep reads the same work-products surface the
board uses; it adds no token or credential. Operator guide:
[guides/task-pr-sync.md](guides/task-pr-sync.md).

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_TASK_PR_SYNC_ENABLED` | TASK-PR-SYNC | `1` (on) | Master switch of the delivering-PR sweep: on — a task is linked to its PRs and settled when they all merge | `0`/`false`/`off`/`no` — disable (tasks stay busy until closed by hand). Unset or unrecognized — enabled: a typo does not silently extinguish the fix |
| `MYRMIDON_TASK_PR_SYNC_POLL_SEC` | TASK-PR-SYNC | `60` | Minimum spacing between two passes; the scheduler queue itself ticks more often | Values below 15 or non-numeric or fractional — the default (60) |
| `MYRMIDON_TASK_PR_SYNC_BATCH_MAX` | TASK-PR-SYNC | `50` | How many candidate tasks one pass inspects at most (each task costs one GitHub resolve per PR) | From 1 to 500; values outside the range or non-numeric — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_TASK_PR_SYNC_SETTLE_DISABLED` | TASK-PR-SYNC | unset (settling on) | Instance-wide lever to make the sweep read and log but never flip a task to `done` — for a deliberate post-deploy hold on every task at once. A task with its own post-deploy gate is already deferred per task (a pending card, a pending approval, or a monitor scheduled for the future) | `1`/`true`/`on`/`yes` — settling off; anything else — settling on. The per-task gate check cannot be disabled by this switch |

## TASK-PR-SYNC WAKE-GUARD — no run for a task whose pull requests all merged

The admission-side half of TASK-PR-SYNC: before the board dispatches a run for
an event-free wake, it checks whether the task's pull_request work products are
all terminal with at least one merged and the task is not settled yet. When so,
the wake is skipped with the vendor skip mechanism (a skipped wakeup request
with reason `wake_skipped_pr_settle_pending`) and the task PR sync sweep closes
the task on its next tick. Human comment and interaction wakes are never
suppressed. The decision is cached per issue so the admission path pays no
database hit per wake.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_TASK_PR_SYNC_WAKE_GUARD_ENABLED` | WAKE-GUARD | `1` (on) | Master switch of the wake guard: on — an event-free wake to a settle-pending task is skipped instead of dispatching a run | `0`/`false`/`off`/`no` — disable (wakes dispatch runs as before). Unset or unrecognized — enabled: a typo does not silently extinguish the fix |
| `MYRMIDON_TASK_PR_SYNC_WAKE_GUARD_TTL_SEC` | WAKE-GUARD | `60` | How long a suppress decision stays cached for one task (matches the sweep's default poll); the cache holds at most 1000 issues, least-recently-used eviction | From 1 to 3600; non-numeric, non-positive or above the cap — the default (60) |
| `MYRMIDON_SWARM_CLAIM_ENABLED` | 1.6-SWARM | `0` (off) | Master switch of the per-role task queues: on — an agent claims the top task of its own role's queue behind a lease (TTL + heartbeat), an expired lease returns the task to the queue and the sweep wakes the next agent of the role; the checkout writes the run's claim, the finishing run releases it. Off — no claim is written and the sweep is a no-op (vendor behavior) | `1`/`true`/`on`/`yes` — enable (the pilot). Unset or unrecognized — off: the pilot must be turned on deliberately |
| `MYRMIDON_SWARM_LEASE_TTL_SEC` | 1.6-SWARM | `900` | How long (sec) a claim's lease stays valid without a heartbeat; the run refreshes it on every checkout pass. The acceptance window (idle agent with a non-empty queue of its role) is one TTL plus one sweep interval | From 60 to 86400; below 60 — 60, above 86400 — 86400. Non-numeric, `0`, negative or fractional — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_SWARM_MAX_ACTIVE_TASKS` | 1.6-SWARM | `3` | The per-agent ceiling of live claims; a capped agent is not handed new work until a lease finishes, expires or is released. `none` — no ceiling (all queue work claimable) | From 1 to 100; `none`/`0` — no ceiling. Non-numeric or fractional — the default |
| `MYRMIDON_SWARM_CLAIM_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SEC` | 1.6-SWARM | `30` | How often (sec) the expired-claim sweep runs on the scheduler tick: it releases expired leases, releases claims whose task left the queue, and wakes the next agent of the released task's role | From 5 to 3600; below 5 — 5. Non-numeric, `0`, negative or fractional — the default |


## 1.6 — BASELINE: frozen metric snapshots

The server part of BASELINE computes, for an arbitrary window and per project
and per agent role, the cycle time, the time in review, the return rate, the
blocked time with its top causes, the runs per task and the LLM cost per task
from the board's own history
(`GET /api/myrmidon/companies/:companyId/baseline/metrics?from&to`). The
periodic job below freezes the last 14 days into `baseline_metric_snapshots`,
so a pilot after the autonomy changes can be compared against the number the
board produced before them.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_BASELINE_INTERVAL_SEC` | 1.6-BASELINE | unset (off) | Period (sec) of the snapshot job: every tick recomputes the last 14 days per company and appends one frozen row to `baseline_metric_snapshots` | Unset or empty — no timer, no query. Set to an integer from 60 to 604800; an unreadable or out-of-range value keeps the job on with the daily default (86400) |

## 1.6 — SKILL-LIFECYCLE: company skill lifecycle

Settings of `server/src/myrmidon/skill-lifecycle/`. A company skill is
`candidate`, `verified` or `deprecated`; only a verified revision is delivered
to agents by default, a candidate goes to the pilot agent set, a deprecated
skill reaches nobody. A skill with no lifecycle row keeps the pre-feature
behaviour and reaches everyone. Promotion needs an approved approval of type
`skill_promotion`; a rollback restores the previous verified revision on the
next compile of every agent that uses the skill. The lifecycle API lives under
`GET/POST /api/myrmidon/companies/:companyId/skill-lifecycle`.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_SKILL_PILOT_AGENTS` | SKILL-LIFECYCLE | unset (empty set) | Comma-separated agent ids that receive `candidate` skills. Any other agent gets a candidate withheld, with a profile warning; `verified` skills reach everyone regardless | Unset or blank — the pilot set is empty, so a candidate reaches nobody (the safe reading of "no pilot configured"). Only agent ids are matched; whitespace around an entry is trimmed |

## 1.6 — AUTONOMY-MATRIX (Part A: matrix, enforcement, regulations API)

The "Autonomy matrix" module (`server/src/myrmidon/autonomy/`, contract —
`packages/shared/src/myrmidon-autonomy.ts`). The matrix maps role x action class to
allowed / approval_required / forbidden; per-role regulations live in the same
JSON store with draft -> approved revisions. Storage: no new DB table — the whole
state sits under `instance_settings.general.myrmidonAutonomy` (the instance-settings
JSON pattern), so vendor writes of `general` must preserve our key
(`preserveAutonomyGeneralKey`, mounted in `server/src/services/instance-settings.ts`).

API surface (company resolved by the access-hub rule: query `companyId`, else the
caller's single active membership, 422 on ambiguity; reads company access,
mutations board):

- `GET /api/myrmidon/autonomy` -> `{ matrix, regulations, changeLog }`
- `PATCH /api/myrmidon/autonomy/matrix` body `{ expectedVersion?, rules, defaults }` -> `{ matrix }` (409 on version mismatch)
- `POST /api/myrmidon/autonomy/regulations` `{ role, title, bodyMarkdown }` -> regulation (draft, revision 1)
- `PATCH /api/myrmidon/autonomy/regulations/:id` `{ title?, bodyMarkdown? }` -> new revision
- `POST /api/myrmidon/autonomy/regulations/:id/approve` -> draft -> approved
- `POST /api/myrmidon/autonomy/regulations/:id/revisions/:rev/restore` -> re-promote a past revision

Change log: `activity_log` rows with actions `myrmidon.autonomy.*`, served as a ready
array in the GET response. Factory default: every cell `allowed` (zero behavior change
until an operator edits; a conservative preset is a follow-up). Enforcement seam:
`server/src/myrmidon/autonomy/gate.ts` (`autonomyGate`) consults `resolveAutonomy` at the
action point — forbidden refuses with a clear error, approval_required maps to the
existing toolActionRequests + approval-card conveyor, allowed passes. Regulations UI
(Part B) edits the matrix through this API.

No environment variables, no new secrets. Remove: the autonomy tree, the export line in
`packages/shared/src/index.ts`, the two marker lines in `app.ts`/`instance-settings.ts`
and this section.
## 1.6 — CTO-CHAT B (the board chat planner: owner text -> proposed epic)

The planner behind the CTO chat (the 1.6 CTO-CHAT epic, part B): the owner's free text
(`POST /api/myrmidon/cto-chat/plan`, body `{ "text": "..." }`, or the same call
from the Telegram DM bridge) becomes a proposed epic with child tasks and
per-task acceptance criteria. The proposal is a plan only: it validates against
the shared zod contract before any card, and nothing is created until the
owner accepts the `suggest_tasks` card on the standing Agent Chat conversation
task. Off unless both the address and the key secret are set: with either
missing the route answers a stable 503 `planner_disabled` with the names of the
missing settings (names only, never values), and not a single request goes out.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_CTO_CHAT_BASE_URL` | 1.6-CTO-CHAT-B | unset (planner closed) | Address of the OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway (e.g. LiteLLM) the planner calls for one completion. Together with `MYRMIDON_CTO_CHAT_KEY_SECRET` it opens the path; without either the route answers 503 `planner_disabled` naming the missing settings | Empty/unset — the path is closed |
| `MYRMIDON_CTO_CHAT_KEY_SECRET` | 1.6-CTO-CHAT-B | unset | **Name** of the company secret holding the gateway API key (not the value). The value is read on every call for the calling company; it never appears in the setting, logs, errors or the journal | Empty/unset — the path is closed. The secret is created by the company's operator in the "Secrets" section |
| `MYRMIDON_CTO_CHAT_MODEL` | 1.6-CTO-CHAT-B | `dashscope-qwen-flash` | The model name sent to the gateway for the planning completion | Empty/unset — the default; an unknown name fails at the gateway and the route answers 400 `backend_failed` |
| `MYRMIDON_CTO_CHAT_TIMEOUT_SEC` | 1.6-CTO-CHAT-B | `90` | Timeout of the planning request (raised to at least 5, capped at 600) | Non-numeric, `0`, negative or above the cap — the default (90) |
| `MYRMIDON_CTO_CHAT_MAX_TASKS` | 1.6-CTO-CHAT-B | `8` | Ceiling on child tasks in one proposal (a proposal can never be unbounded work); the hard absolute cap is 20 | Non-numeric, `0`, negative or above 20 — the default (8) |

The flow end to end — how the owner asks from the portal or the Telegram DM,
what the proposal and the approval card look like, and what acceptance
creates — is the operator guide
[guides/cto-chat-planner.md](guides/cto-chat-planner.md).
## 1.6 — SWARM-CLAIM supervisor and pilot report (part B)

Settings of `server/src/myrmidon/swarm-claim-supervisor/` — the lead's supervisor
view over the per-role claim queues, the rebalance action and the pilot report
of the SWARM-CLAIM epic, part B (`GET /api/myrmidon/companies/:companyId/swarm-claim/supervisor/overview`,
`POST .../supervisor/release-lease`, `GET .../pilot-report`). The claim table
`issue_claims` and its write path belong to part A
(`server/src/myrmidon/swarm-claim/`); this module only reads them, so while part
A is unmerged the supervisor answers `{ enabled: false }`.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_SWARM_SUPERVISOR_TASK_MAX` | 1.6-SWARM-CLAIM-B | `500` | Row cap of queue candidates reported per role in the supervisor overview; a ceiling, not a page size | Positive integer from 1 to 5000; anything else — the default (500). Values above the 5000 ceiling are clamped to it, so a typo cannot ask for an unbounded scan |
| `MYRMIDON_SWARM_PILOT_BASELINE_DOC` | 1.6-SWARM-CLAIM-B | `baseline-snapshot-14d` | Issue document key the pilot report reads the frozen BASELINE snapshot from before comparing a window against it | Empty, blank or unset — the default key. Until a document under the key exists the pilot report answers `baseline: null` (there is nothing to compare the window against yet) |
| `MYRMIDON_SWARM_CLAIM_ENABLED` | 1.6-SWARM-CLAIM-B | unset (on when part A's claim table exists) | Master switch of the swarm claim supervisor view and pilot report: the overview reports the claim/lease state, and the pilot report only compares a window when claims are live. Read as enabled unless the value is exactly `0`, `false`, `off` or `no`; with any other value the module still checks that part A's `issue_claims` table exists before answering enabled | Exact `0`/`false`/`off`/`no` — the supervisor answers `{ enabled: false }` and the pilot report is skipped; any typo or other value is treated as enabled, so an error cannot silently kill the pilot |
| `MYRMIDON_SWARM_LEASE_TTL_SEC` | 1.6-SWARM-CLAIM-B | unset (module default) | Lease time-to-live, in seconds, reported for each active claim in the supervisor overview and used by the pilot report's lease metrics. A positive integer env value wins over everything else | Unset, empty or not a positive integer — falls back to `instance_settings.general.swarmClaim.MYRMIDON_SWARM_LEASE_TTL_SEC` when present, else the module's own default |
| `MYRMIDON_SWARM_MAX_ACTIVE_TASKS` | 1.6-SWARM-CLAIM-B | unset (module default) | Per-agent cap of active claimed tasks reported by the supervisor overview and used by the pilot report's workload metrics. A positive integer env value wins over everything else | Unset, empty or not a positive integer — falls back to `instance_settings.general.swarmClaim.MYRMIDON_SWARM_MAX_ACTIVE_TASKS` when present, else the module's own default |

## 1.6 — FORAGING (source registry, snapshot comparison, skill candidates)

Settings of `server/src/myrmidon/foraging/` (the 1.6 track). The feature is off by default:
without `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_ENABLED=1` no timer is armed, no source is read and the manual
pass answers `503 {enabled: false}`. The registry and the findings list stay readable while
it is off.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_ENABLED` | FORAGING | unset (off) | Master switch of the periodic comparison pass. Only the exact value `1` turns it on: the sweep then reads the enabled sources of every company that has a registry row, once per interval | Any other value (or unset) — the sweep never starts, `POST …/foraging/sweep` answers `503 enabled: false`, and the page shows that passes are off. A typo does not silently turn the feature on |
| `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_INTERVAL_SEC` | FORAGING | `3600` | Period of the pass, in seconds. A pass whose previous run is still going is skipped, not queued | From 60 to 86400; non-integer or out of bounds — `3600` |
| `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_BUDGET_CENTS` | FORAGING | `50` | Ceiling of the cost estimate of one pass, in cents. The sweep prices every fetched kilobyte and stops once the estimate reaches the ceiling; sources after the stop stay untouched and the next pass continues with them | A configured `0` or a negative number is the explicit "no limit"; empty or unset — `50` |
| `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_KEY_SECRET` | FORAGING | unset | **Name** of the company secret whose value is sent as a bearer token to the sources of that company. The value is read for the duration of the read, is never logged and never stored | Empty — sources are read without an authorization header |
| `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_MIN_HOST_INTERVAL_SEC` | FORAGING | `60` | Pause between two reads of one host, in seconds. Shared by every company of the process, so two roles pointing at one host cannot double the rate | From 5 to 86400; non-integer or out of bounds — `60`. A host that fails twice in a row is left alone for 6 h (breaker, not a setting) |

The sweep is off by default because it is the only part of the feature that talks to the
outside: an operator turns it on together with `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_KEY_SECRET` when the
sources need a token. Findings are recorded `unverified` until the skill lifecycle accepts
them as candidates; `POST …/foraging/sweep` (board only) runs one pass by hand.

## 1.6.1 — FORAGING-LIMITS-UI (learning switch and spend limits in the interface)

The switch, the pass tuning and the spend limits of the learning sweep are instance
settings now, not just environment variables: the "Learning (foraging)" section of
Instance → General (`GET`/`PATCH /api/myrmidon/foraging-settings`) writes the
`general.foraging` key of the instance settings row, and the sweep re-resolves that row
on **every** pass — a value changed in the interface is in force with the next pass, no
restart, the same rule RUNTIME-LIMITS uses. The environment variables above do not go
away: an explicitly set variable stays a forced per-key override (the panel shows which
side is in force for each field), and the built-in default is the floor when neither the
row nor the env holds a value. `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_KEY_SECRET` stays env-only: it is a
name of a company secret, not a limit.

The section holds: the enable switch; the pass interval; the same-host pause; the
per-pass budget (cents); the daily and the monthly company ceiling (cents); the daily
role and agent ceilings (cents); the hard/soft enforcement mode; and the cost-per-task
auto-off threshold (cents, mean task cost by BASELINE — above the threshold the sweep
switches itself off). Empty cents field — no limit of that kind.

| Field of `general.foraging` | Env override | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch of the sweep, live: off stops the pass within one interval, on arms it without a restart |
| `intervalSec` | `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_INTERVAL_SEC` | `3600` | Period of the pass in seconds (60–86400) |
| `minHostIntervalSec` | `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_MIN_HOST_INTERVAL_SEC` | `60` | Pause between two reads of one host in seconds (≥ 5) |
| `passBudgetCents` | `MYRMIDON_FORAGING_BUDGET_CENTS` | `null` (no pass ceiling) | Ceiling of one pass's cost estimate, in cents; `null` — no per-pass limit |
| `dailyBudgetCents` | — | `null` | Company ceiling per UTC day; a pass that would cross it stops, the remainder waits for the next UTC day |
| `monthlyBudgetCents` | — | `null` | Company ceiling per UTC month, the same stop semantics |
| `roleBudgetCents` | — | `null` | Daily ceiling for one role (its sources' spend summed) |
| `agentBudgetCents` | — | `null` | Daily ceiling for one agent |
| `enforcement` | — | `"hard"` | `hard` — the stopped pass only raises a notice in the attention feed; `soft` — the notice asks the owner to raise the limit or switch learning off. The stop itself never depends on the mode |
| `autoOffCostPerTaskCents` | — | `null` | Above this mean cost per task (BASELINE) learning switches itself off and signals; `null` — the check is off |

When a limit stops a pass, or the cost threshold switches learning off, a card lands in
the attention feed ("Learning limit", `foraging_limit` source). Every source read is
recorded in the `foraging_spend_events` ledger (cents, role, agent, source URL), and one
`training_charge` finance event per pass makes the learning spend its own "Training" line
in the Costs screen, by kind. `GET /api/myrmidon/companies/:companyId/foraging/spend`
answers the breakdown (by role and source, last 90 days) for that screen and for
checking the ceilings before a pass.


## 1.6 — PARALLEL-HELPERS (delegated helper agents)

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MYRMIDON_BOT_HELPER_MODEL` | PARALLEL-HELPERS | unset (helpers inherit the parent agent's model) | Model that delegated helper children run on when neither the agent card nor the stored `parallelHelpers` instance settings name one. Read from the agent card's environment when the bot profile is built. A deployment value: no model name is baked into the product | Empty/unset — the child uses the parent agent's model (Hermes' own behavior for an unset `delegation.model`) |

## 1.6.1 — TG-NOTIFY-SETTINGS part F: the board UI for the Telegram notification settings

The board-facing half of the Telegram notification settings: the "Telegram
notifications" panel on the System screen of the 2.0 UI (Settings → System,
under the UI-2.0 shell). It edits the company-level `telegramNotify` document
the settings core (part A) stores and serves; no environment variables —
everything is runtime-changeable per company through the same API.

- The panel shows all five sections with their options: the daily digest
  (send time, chat id, topic id, sections), error notifications (chat id,
  topic id, minimum severity, rate limit per hour), owner messages
  (require mention), escalations (stuck hours, channel, chat id, topic id) and
  head-bot proactivity (mode, cap per day in "rarely" mode). With the contract
  defaults every section reads OFF.
- Saving sends one `PATCH /api/myrmidon/telegram-notify` with only the fields
  that differ from the stored values; the answer is applied back, so a change
  is reflected immediately. Editing is board-only on the server; a read
  without board access renders the denied state.
- The settings change log from the GET answer (actor, field path, previous and
  next value) is rendered under the sections — the same changelog the core
  records for every changed field.

## 1.6.1 — TG-NOTIFY head-bot proactivity (part E: gate, rarely limit, U2 bundling)

Settings of `server/src/myrmidon/telegram-notify/` (the proactivity half of the
TG-NOTIFY-SETTINGS epic, part E). The head bot's own-initiative publications are
gated per agent: `only_on_owner_request` (the default — the owner receives only
replies to their own messages and the U2 decision cards), `rarely` (at most
`rarelyMaxPerDay` proactive messages per agent per UTC day, everything beyond
the ceiling is bundled into a daily summary publication), or `normal` (no
limit). The mode and the ceiling live in the `proactivity` area of the
`telegramNotify` settings document (instance settings, runtime-changeable; the
contract and defaults are defined in `packages/shared/src/myrmidon-telegram-notify.ts`).
A per-agent override uses the same enum under the `mode` key of the agent's
metadata and wins over the company default.

Storage: no new tables. The rarely day counters and the bundle queues sit under
`instance_settings.general.myrmidonTelegramNotify` (the instance-settings JSON
pattern; preserved across vendor `general` writes). The U2 card bundling turns
several pending interaction cards older than 5 minutes in one conversation into
one summary publication; each bundled card keeps its own callback action rows,
so every card stays individually answerable.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `telegramNotify.proactivity.mode` (settings area) | 1.6-TG-PROACTIVITY-E | `only_on_owner_request` | Proactivity of the head bot per company: `only_on_owner_request` blocks every own-initiative publication; `rarely` allows at most `rarelyMaxPerDay` per agent per day and bundles the rest; `normal` removes the limit | Any other value is rejected by the validator; a malformed stored value falls back to the default |
| `telegramNotify.proactivity.rarelyMaxPerDay` (settings area) | 1.6-TG-PROACTIVITY-E | `3` | Daily ceiling of proactive messages per agent in `rarely` mode; the counter resets on the UTC day boundary | Integer from 1 to 50; anything else falls back to 3 |
| agent metadata key `mode` | 1.6-TG-PROACTIVITY-E | unset | Per-agent override of the mode (the same three values). Wins over the company default for that agent | A malformed value is ignored — the company default applies; an override can only pick one of the three modes |

No environment variables, no new secrets. The gate runs inside the chat
publication sweep; the bundling window is fixed at 5 minutes. Remove: the
`server/src/myrmidon/telegram-notify/` tree, the export line in
`packages/shared/src/index.ts`, the two marker lines in `app.ts` and
`instance-settings.ts`, and this section.

## 1.6.1 — WIP-LIMIT: the WIP limit screen and badge (part B, UI)

The UI half of the WIP-LIMIT feature: the "WIP limit" screen in Company
Settings (`/company/settings/wip-limit`) edits the contract of part A —
`GET/PUT /api/myrmidon/companies/:companyId/wip-limit/settings`
(`{ defaultLimit, perAgent }`, empty default = no limit) — and the agents
list shows each agent's live `wip/limit` badge from
`GET .../wip-limit/status` (red when `overLimit`). No environment variables,
no new secrets: the values live in part A's store. While part A is unmerged
the routes answer nothing — the screen shows its error state and the roster
shows no badge, both harmless. Remove: the `ui/src/components/myrmidon/wip-limit/`
tree, `AgentWipBadge.tsx`, the nav item, the route, the `Agents.tsx` status
query/badge and the `wipLimit` i18n namespace.

| Variable | Function | Default | What it does | How to disable / special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | 1.6.1-WIP-LIMIT-B | — (always on) | The settings screen writes the row through part A's PUT; the badge on an agent row reads the status endpoint | Not configurable: no deployment-specific values in the UI half |
