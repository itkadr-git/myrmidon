# Myrmidon changelog

Release notes for Myrmidon, newest first. The version comes from the git tag
`myr-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (CI stamps it into the image and `/api/health`); there is no
version file to edit. Base Paperclip version is in the image label
`io.github.itkadr-git.myrmidon.base.paperclip-version`. Details of the release procedure:
[ci.md](ci.md) and [deploy.md](deploy.md).

## 1.2.0

Everything merged after the 1.1.0 tag, including fixes that were never tagged on their own.

### Bot containers

- Per-bot board tool gateway: container bots reach the board through their own scoped gateway.
- Shared media tools MCP service for container bots, with fixes for filter-escape injection,
  job-directory quota counting, streamed conversions and spool ownership.
- `dockergate`: an allowlisting Docker proxy for bot containers.
- Bot image: Node.js variant (`runtime-node`), an ssh client, and a venv interpreter present
  for the bot user.
- Bot board API keys are issued with a responsible user.
- Configurable run-create timeout for the hermes gateway (default 60 s).
- Container startup feedback in the server tests no longer needs a real container.

### Memory and isolation

- Hindsight bank allowlist and observation scopes in bot profiles, plus a tool to split
  banks when transferring memory.
- Plugin `apiRoute` calls are bound to an invocation scope.

### Wakes and heartbeat

- Continuation wakes: age-threshold sweep and direct-delivery settlement fixed.
- Tasks stranded by an operator pause are woken in batches when the pause is lifted.
- Configurable cap on cross-issue influence.
- Heartbeat logs an unreadable cgroup memory limit; the cap is documented.
- Kill-switch flag semantics are covered by a test matrix and a docs guard; documented that the
  L2 budget carry is L1-only and that the vendor retry budget restarts at the successor.

### Deploy

- Deploy lifts maintenance mode when the drain times out.
- Documented that database migrations must be additive-only.

### Process

- Plan intake procedure and text scanner for plan entries.
- Publish scan wrapper for PR and issue text.
