"""The destination journal — the whole point of log-only mode (EGRESS-A).

One line per request a bot sends through the proxy, as compact JSON so the
observation period's inventory (which project reaches which host) can be read
back with `grep`/`jq` instead of a parser. The line names the bot and its
project, the destination and the outcome. It never carries a credential: the
proxy user is taken out of `Proxy-Authorization` and the header itself is
dropped — that value is the only thing in a proxy request that is a secret.
