# Deploys a Myrmidon image by digest. Only images built by CI are deployed.
#
#   deploy.sh --config deploy.env --digest sha256:<64 hex> [--dry-run]
#             [--expect-version V] [--expect-commit SHA] [--force]
#
# --digest takes sha256:<64 hex> or ghcr.io/itkadr-git/myrmidon@sha256:<64 hex>.
#
# Before anything else (before the pull, the dump and maintenance) the script
# refuses unless: the reference is exactly ghcr.io/itkadr-git/myrmidon@sha256:<64 hex>
# (no tag, no other repository); the image is in the registry; its
# org.opencontainers.image.revision label names a commit that is on origin/main
# or carries a myr-v* tag (git fetch in the clone that holds these scripts).
# There is no flag to skip this check, --force does not skip it either.
#
# Steps: pull the image by digest; remember the current digest as "previous";
# dump the database (DUMP_COMMAND, refuses an empty dump); enter maintenance;
# wait until no runs are in progress. The window drains for the short grace
# (MAINTENANCE_DRAIN_GRACE_SEC, 300 s by default) and then interrupts whatever
# is still running; the interrupted runs are retried when the window closes
# (MAINTENANCE_ON_TIMEOUT=wait keeps the old "wait for the long timeout"
# behaviour). A drain timeout lifts maintenance again and aborts before the
# image changes; then switch the image line in the compose override file and
# recreate only the server service; verify /api/health (status, version,
# commit); leave maintenance (myrmidon EXIT-ASYNC: the exit call returns as soon
# as the window is `leaving`, then the script waits for the window to retire,
# not for the HTTP call); run the post-deploy fleet check (no issue became
# blocked in the deploy window, the window retired).
#
# RELEASE-GATE (the 01.10 incident): the release's component images roll out
# together with the board, in this same run. After the board image check
# resolves and verifies the matching dockergate and fleetd digests (same
# release: the tag the board image was built from, or the short sha of its
# commit; see ../dockergate/check-release-support.sh). A release whose
# component digests are missing is refused BEFORE anything changes. After the
# board is healthy each component is pulled, switched and health-checked
# (rollout-component.sh); a failing component health is DEGRADED, not silent.
# Last, a post-deploy smoke (bot-apply-smoke.sh) waits for at least one bot
# container to re-apply; failing that within its window the deploy reports
# DEGRADED and prints the rollback commands.
#
# On a failed health check the script stops with maintenance still on and
# prints the rollback command. --dry-run changes nothing and prints the plan
# (the image checks are read-only, so they run in a dry run too).
#
# TRACING-HEALTH: right after the health check the deploy verifies the LLM
# tracing callbacks of the gateway (tracing-check.sh): the legacy `langfuse`
# callback against a v4 Langfuse server is refused, and the deploy stops like a
# failed health check — maintenance stays on and the rollback command is
# printed. There is no flag that skips the refusal. Without a MYRMIDON_TRACING_*
# setting the check logs that it is skipped, so an installation without a
# tracing gateway still deploys.
