#   deploy.sh --config deploy.env --digest sha256:<64 hex> [--dry-run]
#             [--expect-version V] [--expect-commit SHA] [--force]
#
# --digest takes sha256:<64 hex> or ghcr.io/itkadr-git/myrmidon@sha256:<64 hex>.
#
# Before anything else (before the pull, the dump and maintenance) the script
# refuses unless: the reference is exactly ghcr.io/itkadr-git/myrmidon@sha256:<64 hex>
# (no tag, no other repository); the image is in the registry; its
# org.opencontainers.image.revision label names a commit that is on origin/main
# or carries a myr-v* tag (git fetch in the clone that holds these scripts).
# There is no flag to skip this check, --force does not skip it either.
#
# Steps: pull the image by digest; remember the current digest as "previous";
# dump the database (DUMP_COMMAND, refuses an empty dump); enter maintenance;
# wait until no runs are in progress (a drain timeout lifts maintenance again
# and aborts before the image changes); switch the image line in the compose
# override file and recreate only the server service; verify /api/health
# (status, version, commit); leave maintenance.
#
# On a failed health check the script stops with maintenance still on and
# prints the rollback command. --dry-run changes nothing and prints the plan
# (the image check is read-only, so it runs in a dry run too).
