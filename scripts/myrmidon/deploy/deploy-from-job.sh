#
# The board (deploy-jobs module, server/src/myrmidon/deploy-jobs) never runs
# docker itself: it verifies the image digest, opens the maintenance window
# and writes a job into its state. This script is the host half: it polls the
# board API for a dispatchable job, waits for the maintenance window to be
# fully on, runs the SAME deploy.sh (with its mandatory CI-image check, dump,
# drain, health verification) for the job digest, and reports the outcome as a
# small JSON file the board reads (STATE_DIR/job-<id>.json, mounted read-only
# into the board container as MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_REPORTS_DIR).
#
# Report phases: claimed → switching → switched → health-ok | health-failed |
# error. With AUTO_ROLLBACK=1 (the default; the board's
# MYRMIDON_DEPLOY_AUTO_ROLLBACK is the same switch on the board side) a failed
# deploy does not stop at health-failed: the executor immediately runs the
# same rollback.sh against the image deploy.sh remembered before the switch
# (the locally known previous image — rollback is the emergency path, the
# CI-image check there only warns), reports rolling-back → rolled-back |
# rollback-failed, and the board closes the job as auto_rolled_back (window
# left) or failed_rollback (window kept on for the operator). AUTO_ROLLBACK=0
# restores the manual contract: health-failed, window on, the operator rolls
# back by hand.
#
# The script exits when no dispatchable job is left and --once was given, or
# keeps polling (one executor per host; a second instance refuses to start by
# holding STATE_DIR/executor.lock).
#
# Requires: bash 4+, docker, curl, jq, git (the same tools as deploy.sh).
